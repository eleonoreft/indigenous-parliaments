Line Repairs and Power Limiters in Nunakput during COVID-19 Pandemic
2020-05-13 10:15:50,581 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — New oral question.
2020-05-13 10:15:50,581 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. JACOBSON: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I have questions today for the Minister responsible for the NWT Power Corporation on being proactive and not reactive, Mr. Speaker, in supporting our communities' action plan with regard to safety of lines, power lines that are in the communities that need to be redone before this COVID-19 our communities. Because I really worry about, if a blizzard hits and a lineman being sick and come to attend to our community, how do we fix that, Mr. Speaker? Will the Minister commit today to make sure that all the Nunakput communities, the line crews go in and then start working and making sure that the lines are properly fixed and ready for the next blizzard? Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

First of all, I'd like to thank my colleague from Nunakput for actually phoning and working with me this past weekend to help his residents. He was very diligent in working for his residents. In regard to his concern, our staff have been out there working hard to make sure we had proper power installed, getting it back in place, and that we're also working to ensure it doesn't happen again, but with weather, we can't predict it. We are working with it, and there is a strategic plan moving forward to work with all residents of the Northwest Territories to ensure these things don't happen again.

2020-05-13 10:15:50,590 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — If people haven't gone in and set up payment plans in the communities with smart meters, our load limit policy will be changed from 15 minutes on / 15 minutes off to 15 minutes on / 5 minutes off to ensure the homes are safe and kept warm;
2020-05-13 10:15:50,591 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — In communities that have manual meters, consumers may exceed the 15 amps usage will continue to have their powers undisturbed until the meter is manually reset. The meters can be reset by the customers; and

I'm really worried about our communities, our elders, people who we represent in our communities, because we know all of them. I really think that we really should think about this, from now until June, take all limiters off. The Minister could make that happen. Would the Minister commit to me today to getting that done?

2020-05-13 10:15:50,593 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. SHANE THOMPSON: I can't make that commitment. The commitment we've made is we'll reach out and work with these individuals to come up with payment plans. If they've fallen in payment plans, limiters will not be installed. If people don't come up with payment plans, then we will install the new process of 15 minutes on / 5 minutes off, and then, for people who don't have smart meters, that have 15 amps, then they would have to reset manually. We are working with the residents; however, we also have to be diligent in us moving forward so I think this is a good option.

2020-05-13 10:15:50,606 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. JACOBSON: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The payment plans, I guess, for all our riding of Nunakput would have to go through Inuvik because we don't have any Power Corporation offices and that would be basically for the whole Delta. Would the Minister provide numbers for the people for our ridings of the whole Beaufort Delta in regard to if they're in arrears with the power corporation, to make sure that his staff know in Inuvik that the payment plan will be signed, and they don't have to worry about it, so the limiters will be not put on? That's the worst thing that we need, because it's still cold weather back in the Delta and we don't need this. Would the Minister commit today to making sure that happens?

2020-05-13 10:15:50,622 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. CAROLINE COCHRANE: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I don't have current statistics on where, exactly, the tourism industry is within the Northwest Territories; however, it doesn't take very much research to look outside our doors and see that the numbers are going down. There are two things that are happening. One, the numbers are going down, and the public is concerned that we still have tourists on our streets. I'd like to first of all say that all tourists have been asked to self-isolate when they come into Canada. We have brought up the concerns to the federal government in talking about international travel. It's really hard to self-isolate when people come into the NWT for one or two days. It is something that we're working on with the federal government and it will impact the tourism sector within the Northwest Territories and throughout Canada, Mr. Speaker. Thank you.

2020-05-13 10:15:50,623 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MS. GREEN: I appreciate that response. The ITI Minister previously committed to more robust data collection about impacts. That's important, but it doesn't seem like the highest priority right now. My question is: what can the Premier do to support tourism operators who have had to cancel tours and lay off staff through this spring and summer?

2020-05-13 10:15:50,624 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. CAROLINE COCHRANE: We are concerned about our economy. We're concerned about all businesses in the NWT, including the tourism industry. Right now, at this time, like I said, we're waiting for the federal government. They are in charge of travel airlines. We are asking for them to actually confirm how they will ensure that our residents are safe with the amount of tourists, which does imply that we're asking them to support not having travellers come to the Northwest Territories internationally, as well.

2020-05-13 10:15:50,625 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — It's already impacting. We've already got letters from the tourist industry. We've got letters from airlines. We've got letters from the business communities already. The economy is going to hurt. What I can say is that we have brought those concerns to the federal government. Concerns have been voiced from every jurisdiction across Canada. Our federal government is looking for changes; they're looking at programs such as making adjustments to the EI that might be able to help people. At this time, all I can say is the federal government is aware of our concerns. They know that we're looking for some kind of economic stimulus, some kind of economic benefit for us, and they have promised to get back to us and they've promised to take the considerations of the whole territories into consideration.
2020-05-13 10:15:50,637 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MS. GREEN: I appreciate that answer. I see that the onus is really on the federal government to come up with some kind of contingency fund to assist not only tourism operators but also sectors of the economy that are currently hurting. What kind of responsibility does the GNWT have in this circumstance other than connecting with the federal government to come up with those contingency plans?

2020-05-13 10:15:50,638 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. CAROLINE COCHRANE: For businesses that are a little bit worried or need some extra assistance, they can contact our Department of ITI for assistance. We do have the Business Development Program that might be able to assist them in some long-term plans. We're looking at bumping up; we're working. Right now, the priority is on health and safety. I have to put that. Right now, we're scrambling to figure out how we're going to take care of our residents, our long-term care, our most vulnerable in society. At the same time, we're looking at the economic detriments, so we're looking at increase, probably, in Income Support, people on Income Support. Again, we're advocating to the federal government for EI. We're looking at tools and resources that will be able to help our industry. It's a day-to-day battle that we're facing right now, an hour-to-hour battle. Our officials, all of our Ministers, myself, we're all getting updated regularly every single day. Things are changing every day. All I can say is the federal government does know our needs and we're trying to work as best we can with our limited resources.

2020-05-13 10:15:50,640 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MS. GREEN: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you to the Premier for that. I appreciate that the focus is on health and safety, but I think that there are people and businesses who are stressed about their livelihood because, the businesses they own or the businesses they work for, they don't necessarily have generous sick times or contingency plans to keep people going while they have to be off work for circumstances that are beyond their control. I would really urge the Premier to task the ITI staff with a recovery plan, to use those federal resources when they come through, to see if there is anything that can be repurposed in our budget that would help people to continue with their livelihoods. What I'm concerned about is that we will have the health crisis, and then we'll go into an economic crisis because of the health crisis. Can the Minister assure me that that kind of planning will take place? Thank you,

2020-05-13 10:15:50,641 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. CAROLINE COCHRANE: The Member is correct. Once the health crisis is done, whether we end up with a huge incidence of a number of residents with COVID-19 or not, this is going to impact our businesses in the Northwest Territories. It's not only the tourism business; it's all businesses that we are worried about at this point. We are working diligently within our departments and across jurisdictions with the federal government to come up with an economic plan. At this point, though, it would be irresponsible for us to just start bailing out one or two businesses, because my instinct is telling me that more businesses will be impacted by this, so we need to make sure that we plan fully and that we have a comprehensive plan as we move forward. That is my commitment, that we're on this now and, as soon as we have some more information, we will be sharing that with the public and the business community. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

We are working with translators to record public service announcements on COVID-19 that we have played on CKLB, CBC Radio, and other community radio stations. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

The Prime Minister of Canada stated that no one should have to worry about paying rent, buying groceries, or finding childcare. I recommend that should also include not going without electricity in our northern communities, whether it's for five minutes, 10 minutes, or the day, during this time, and I would hope that the Minister responsible for the Power Corporation would stand up and take a stand on that. Also, we shouldn't be evicting people from their houses.

The Minister of Finance has a call with the federal Finance Minister this afternoon, actually, to find out that information. We do know that the federal government has put aside a billion dollars already for health issues that there may be with COVID-19. However, our portion of that monies is just under $600,000, if I remember correctly, and I have already said that that is not enough. We're dealing with the health issues, what he's looking at giving us now, and when the economy comes, my instinct is telling me that my first words will be, "That is not enough."

ITI and Infrastructure are looking at how we can do the procurement, make sure that people are paid timely during this crisis, et cetera. All departments are looking at the influx of additional costs that are going to come. People who are going to be laid off of work will be impacting our systems, so income support is on that. We have asked for every department to now do tabletop exercises to see how they will react if people get sick and we have a public outcry for services.

We do know that there will be a downturn in our economy. We know that there is a downturn in the economy happening across Canada, so we are trying to plan not only about the financial rest tuition of businesses; we are also trying to plan currently about how we keep our supply chain open. Those are questions that we're asking now. Again, looking at the economic stimulus, after the fact is a little bit premature when, right now, we're worried about the health of people and making sure that our groceries get into the Northwest Territories.

Can they look at loans? Can they look at EI? All of those factors are being looked at by the federal government, and every jurisdiction across Canada is looking at how we can assist not only our residents but our businesses, and we are all working in partnership as we go forward. Daily conversations are happening, so that hopefully we are all in the same place, because we are all experiencing the same impacts by this to different degrees.

I am not going to commit on what the solution will be. What I commit to is that we will have those discussions and we will be looking at the least impact possible relating to COVID-19. We cannot just shut down every collection, every business happening in the Northwest Territories, or every bill out of speculation, but we will be having those discussions. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

A few schools were closing their doors, but most were moving online, as the Member said, so classes aren't necessarily cancelled. Courses have moved online.

2020-05-13 10:15:50,739 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — A lot of universities are also keeping their facilities, their resources open, like libraries, and so students might make the choice to stay down and finish their semester there because they need access to those types of resources. That being said, some who have the ability to complete their entire courses online might want to come back home. We haven't communicated that to them yet, seeing as how this happened over the weekend and everyone has been working full-out, but we will have that communication with them. Students who want to return home early, depending on the status of their post-secondary education, we will work with them to provide their travel home funds at an earlier date so they can get home. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
2020-05-13 10:15:50,740 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MS. CLEVELAND: In the case where students are expected or end up coming home, because this is progressing quickly and we don't know where we are going to be at the end of the week, if students do end up coming home early, will the department of education be looking at what they can do for students in the event that students end up with an incomplete for the year but are still on the line for student loans?

A mass of universities are trying to pull this off over the weekend. I am open to doing what we can to ensure people aren't adversely affected by this pandemic, but I can't make any guarantees at this point, given that things are still new and we have so little information.

In that case, how is the Department of Education, Culture and Employment communicating what it means to self-isolate and who is responsible for self-isolating to day home providers?

Similar to the schools, I don't have the authority to close day homes, as it is being done in other jurisdictions, but if there is a serious health concern, the Chief Public Health Officer likely has the ability to close that. If people do have concerns about what is going on, they should be bringing those forward.

2020-05-13 10:15:50,759 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — In the South Slave, they haven't had spring break yet. Perhaps they just don't have a spring break and they finish early. There are things like what happened in Alberta, where they cancelled school until basically next September, so it is still too early to know what is going on, but I can tell the Members of this House that it is my desire to continue educating children even in light of the physical closures of schools. I don't want to just abandon this school year. I want to ensure that our grads, people who can graduate, are able to graduate, and I want to ensure that we don't allow our students to fall further behind by just giving up on their education for the rest of this year. 
2020-05-13 10:15:50,772 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — What that looks like, I am not sure. The staff in the department have been working with the NWT Teachers' Association, have been working with the superintendents and the school boards to try and figure out how we can continue delivering education in light of these closures. That is where we are right now, and this recommendation came in a few hours ago, so the plans are still in the process of being made. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

If everyone does what the chief medical officer is asking, that they self-isolate if they have travelled internationally, if they are using good hygiene, if they are washing their hands, don't go to visit your elders, probably, in the long-term care facilities if you're sick, might be good advice.

It has been a discussion that has been happening in some detail for some time, since January, really, but these plans are plans that have existed long before now. They are plans that were developed last year when we were facing the strike and owing from years before when they were dealing with H1N1. There are different gradients for each department. There are different needs for each department. We have to consider our health department and our essential services first, make sure that their needs are being met, make sure that we're also looking at whether or not we have the technical capacity to increase having people off working online. All of those things are being discussed and considered right now. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

2020-05-13 10:15:50,806 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. JOHNSON: I appreciate that answer. My concern here is that all of these things work together, and if we are closing schools, people lose childcare. If we are losing day homes, people lose childcare, and it's important that, if we're asking people to continue showing up to offices when they could be working from home, but they don't have childcare, we are putting them in a very difficult situation. My question to the Minister of Finance is: are people remote working now, those who are able?

Beyond that, anyone who has concerns or needs, such as childcare, resulting from the current situation ought to be speaking to their supervisor. All departments, I am sure, I am confident, are working closely and working with human resources to support their people right now in whatever circumstances they might find themselves, whether it's because they've returned from international travel or if they are needing to care for someone who is in that situation. If there is a need like that, I would suggest that every single department is aware and that the supervisors are aware and that they are in contact with human resources, and we will, for the time being, face that one step at a time.

We have to build the technical capacity. I believe that we should start doing this now. We should start piloting sending different sections of departments who can work from home to do it. I'm not talking about front-line healthcare workers, obviously, or essential services, but we are the largest employer in this territory, and I believe that many of our workers should be working from home now. If we are closing schools and daycares and closing mass gatherings, it does not make sense to have 5,000 public civil servants who can work from home being at work. My question is: will the Minister of Finance start directing departments to begin their workers remote working?

The conversations about the technology have started. TSC and Information and Shared Services are already working together.

Departments are running tabletop exercises this week. They're determining whether or not they need to change the way that they are offering their programs and services, and whether work is done a certain way, and I am confident that, if the time arises where they need to have a directive, then that directive will issue. Until that time, if individuals can't attend work because they are sick, because they've returned, because they have childcare arising from what is happening, then they should be taking that up department by department, and each department is well aware that there are options for workers and that we are working to increase those options and to evaluate whether we need to change that as we go forward.

The first question I have could be departmental, I am not sure, but since it's related to health, Health and Social Services. We received a statement from the Minister of health that states that we are strongly advising all travellers on the international to be self-isolated. We are advising them, so we are not directing them or telling them. Mr. Speaker, tourists who are coming from outside, international travels, it's at their pleasure if they want to go to do self-isolation, but it's not a mandatory thing. Is that a correct saying, that it's an option for international travellers coming to Northwest Territories to be self-isolated? Masi.

It's great that we don't have COVID-19, the coronavirus here in the Northwest Territories, but we have to be proactive instead of reacting to certain things. Why couldn't we have a seniors' care package that Members identified and also the possibility of having workers work from home? Those are some areas that we can easily do within our mandate as the Government of the Northwest Territories. I am afraid that, if we are not proactive on self-isolation with interaction towards coming into the Northwest Territories, we may be impacted. We are trying to prevent that from happening. I highly encourage this government to seriously consider that. Obviously, we have to work with public medical officers, as well.

I have a third question pertaining to school, the school closure. We have the highest person who advises us. The Chief Public Health Officer advised today to close NWT schools until after Easter. We are saying, "Well, it's up to the DEA to deal with that." This is the highest decision-maker coming down, advising us to close our schools, and here we are still debating that.

The first is that a number of news releases or public advisories have gone out with phone numbers for people to call in the event that they have symptoms to report. My constituent called the Yellowknife number, which is the public health unit number, yesterday afternoon, and there was no answer. I'm concerned that, in fact, these numbers are only monitored during work hours. Can the Minister assure me that there is some kind of seven-day-a-week coverage of these phone numbers that are being advertised to people to call? Thank you.

If somebody feels that they have symptoms and they require testing, a two-day delay can result in a lot more exposure between them, their families, and the public in a grocery store or any other place. Can the Minister make a commitment to have at least one number that everyone can call 24-7 to talk to somebody in person about their symptoms?

This government is following the advice of the Chief Public Health Officer, and the advice of the Chief Public Health Officer is not to shut down the schools. I don't even have the authority to shut down the schools. I can't tell the DEAs or the DECs to shut down the schools. Legislatively, it's just not in my toolbox. The DEAs and DECs do have the authority, though, to close schools temporarily for public safety issues, so if they believe that there is a public safety issue, then they have that ability, but it's not being recommended at this time. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

We have to make a stand in regard to this COVID-19. People are worried; people are panicked. The thing is, I'm not trying to put people into a panic, but I'm just making sure that, when the teachers are coming back from the South, or anybody coming back from the South for spring break, if the DEA says, okay, we're going to shut down the school for two weeks after, making sure that the teachers get paid and the Minister supports the local DEAs on that call.

I just want to let everyone know that this is a very serious concern. I take this very seriously, as do all the Cabinet Ministers. This has been our lives for the last little while, now. This is what we're focused on, is making preparations for this. There are a lot of concerns about blanket closures of schools. It can't be overstated, the types of socioeconomic impacts that closing a school can have on a community. There are childcare concerns. It would mean people would have to stay home from work. Some of those people might be healthcare workers, and they might not be able to go in and do the work that they need to, right now. So there are a lot of factors to consider, and I don't want to say that schools will be open forever. There are situations where they could be closed, but that is not my call to make. We are relying on the advice of the chief public health officer.

There were protocols in place for the H1N1 outbreak years back. Those are being updated. I know the elders are especially vulnerable. I can't speak for the Chief Public Health Officer, and I'm not going to give medical advice, but I would imagine he would want elders to stay away from places where they could contract this virus.

Because the DEAs are regular people in the community. If they are having to have the power to do this, to make this decisions, or our regional council, they need to have some one-on-one time with a health professional who can actually give them the education to make the call. I would like to see if the two Ministers will commit to having that conversation with our DEAs in the regional board.

I can't commit health staff to do one-on-one work with all the DEAs because I'm not sure what the health staff are up to, but I can talk to my Cabinet colleague. Getting information to the people who need that information is a priority.

In addition to that, there are some operating guidelines. There are new reporting relationships being developed, and all of that work, again, is occurring at present. It's ongoing. Again, that's where I say the regulations are expected to come into play in spring of 2020, so in the next few months, and how that rolls out will then depend on the development of the policies and the training.

I don't want to see that. I would rather see our government be proactive on this, so I had a quick question for the Minister of Health and Social Services. I am kind of concerned about the small communities. Does the Minister have any backup nurses in case the current nurses are unable to work? Marsi cho.

I want to take this opportunity to talk about this coronavirus, the COVID-19, and I want to advise the following. The health and social services system has been preparing for a potential NWT outbreak since early February, based on emerging information from the World Health Organization and the federal government. The Office of the Chief Public Health Officer has developed guidelines for Northwest Territories health professionals and has issued regular alerts so that the health and social services workforce is being kept informed. Clinical resources will continue to be developed to reflect the latest advice from the international and national infectious disease experts, with guidance from the Chief Public Health Officer and staff, and is being provided to the frontline daily.

2020-05-13 10:15:52,555 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — The Northwest Territories Health and Social Services Authority held a first staff information session last week, where the Chief Public Health Officer presented on the coronavirus. The Northwest Territories Health and Social Services Authority has also been retraining staff on the use of personal protection equipment, hand hygiene, proper hand-washing techniques, and have provided education sheets on the COVID-19 over the last four weeks. Presently, the Northwest Territories Health and Social Services Authority have scheduled weekly all-Northwest Territories Health and Social Services Authority staff calls to provide information. Should the frequency of these calls needs to be increased, that will be done. I do want to talk a little bit more about the process, if that is okay; I think this is important, and I just want to go further into detail. I apologize to the House. 
2020-05-13 10:15:52,556 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — The swab testing kit for coronavirus is a standard nasopharyngeal swab. The swab resembles a large Q-tip, that is used to swab the back of your throat. This is a standard item stocked in all of our facilities. I have been assured that the Northwest Territories Health and Social Services has also been delivering more swabs to all of the staffed health centres. Once a test is taken, it is sent to the provincial lab in Alberta, with a three-to-seven-day turnaround time for results, depending on your location. 
2020-05-13 10:15:52,556 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — The Northwest Territories Health and Social Services Authority wants to ensure that all of their testing for COVID-19 are being directed to individuals who meet the screening criteria. The criteria for screening includes people returning from outside the Northwest Territories who develop symptoms after 14 days of recent travel. Symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. So, if residents have travelled and are developing symptoms, they are being asked to self-isolate, contact their local health centre or the public health unit for information on how to coordinate testing, and also refer to the department's frequently asked questions posted on the website along with the attached information sheets on self-monitoring and self-isolation for more information. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

We're looking across at different provinces to see what they're doing, because Alberta has gone through a change, Saskatchewan has changed, BC, and so we're looking at all of this. I think the Member has a great point that, if we can incorporate northern art and those types of things into our curriculum, that would be great. So I will definitely look into this.

My final question today is in regard to the CALM courses that northern students currently complete in grade 10, and CALM traditionally is where students can work on resumes and they get their volunteer hours, but we hear frequently from northern youth that they need more than that in order to get themselves ready for real life. They want budgeting classes, and they want to know how to do their taxes, and they would like to know how to do business development training. A lot of people in the North do go out and start their own businesses. So would the Minister of Education, Culture and Employment also be willing to look at the CALM curriculum so that it includes more real-life experience and education for our northern youth? Thank you.

2020-05-13 10:15:52,606 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. R.J. SIMPSON: That is something we're looking at. CALM has been around since I was in high school, and, frankly, there has always been talk that it could be done better, and I've heard that very recently, as well. So, for decades now, there have been desires to make it more relevant and, with our proposed pathways to education that the department is looking at, there are proposals to change what we now know as CALM, which is a three-credit course, to a series of one-credit courses, including financial literacy, 10 and 12; mental health and healthy relationships, 10; adult and child development. In addition, the current one-credit career and program plan completed in grade 9 is being replaced by a suite of career and transition plan courses to be taught in each year of high school, for a total of four credits, and these courses are meant to guide and support students in figuring out their future goals. So there are changes coming down the pipe to make it more relevant and address the very issues that the Member is speaking of. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

They're considering the fact that we have to fly people into communities to provide those services. Everything from power and housing, straight down to corrections, all departments are aware of these important situations. They are planning for current situations, but also should there, in fact, be a need to change and to amplify what's being done, that is being looked at by human resources, as I say, in part, but also by all of the other departments in lead and also the Department of Municipal and Community Affairs who are engaged at the community level and who are taking a lead in terms of emergency preparedness.

Yes, the Department of Finance began running models on potential impacts of the coronavirus already some time ago. We continue to update those models as the situation progresses, and we are also, of course, in contact with our partners in the federal government. The federal government has already announced funding coming through to all provinces and territories to support the incurring of expenses, but also to support the impacts, such as impacts to small businesses and to individuals.

To the extent that they come through the Government of the Northwest Territories, the Government of the Northwest Territories is going to ensure that we are acting promptly and swiftly to make sure that we are supporting those who need support during this time.

As the Minister responsible for the Official Languages Act, I can say that our department, ECE, I don't believe we are legislatively required to provide language interpretation training, but we have taken it upon ourselves to work towards that goal. Right now, there is a lack of Indigenous language speakers in the territory, as the Member knows. It makes it difficult to train interpreters when there are not enough people who speak the language to pick from. There are a number of things happening right now. A lot of those are helping us work towards training enough language speakers so that we can begin to better train language interpreters. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

There is money that flows through ECE directly to Indigenous governments, and they are free to do what they wish with it. They use it for language training, all sorts of different events. We don't have control over what targets they might set. We do have our action plan to help revitalize languages. In that, we lay out a number of steps we want to take to help get to that point.

Most of them are on the verge of retirement. I would like to know if there is a plan in place, either now or if the department is working on one, that can be provided to me. In the next five years, next 10 years, how is that going to look? We have valuable services here. They are going to be retiring sooner than later. We need to be ready for that for the community.

Just to let you know, the department is very supportive of this. In the 2019-2020 fiscal year, the GNWT provided $20.4 million for Indigenous language education initiatives, and 5.9 of that was federally funded. The vast majority of that comes from the territorial government. A quarter of the funding was distributed directly to regional Indigenous governments for language revitalization initiatives; $9 million was committed to implementing NWT action plan that I spoke of earlier; and $11.6 million was allocated to implementing the Indigenous language in education policy, which supports the development of Indigenous languages in schools. There is a lot of work that is happening. I wish we could say we were further along. One of the important things we need is partnerships. We need speakers. We need people to want to get into these programs and learn the language. Part of this is talking about the importance of it and trying to get our youth involved, as well. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

One question I have is: we have cancelled most or all the trips outside the NWT, but we still have people coming into the Northwest Territories. Is there a plan in place to deal with that matter? I am not sure if it will be to Health or Justice or the Deputy Premier, Mr. Speaker; I will leave it to you. Masi.

2020-05-13 10:15:52,810 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. CAROLINE WAWZONEK: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Yes, I feel like we are all wearing sort of a collective Ministers responsible for supporting GNWT through the COVID virus hat right now, so it just so happens that I think the department of human resources or division of human resources might have had some of the most recent information on this. Just to reassure that on a broad scale, at this point, anyone coming in or out, coming into the NWT, it is suggested that they consider monitoring for their symptoms and consider whether or not they need to self-isolate. 
2020-05-13 10:15:52,811 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — Previous question.

2020-05-13 10:15:52,822 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — As far as leave provisions, non-essential travel outside of NWT, as I said earlier, is being restricted and travel within the NWT is being looked at department-by-department in order to ensure that essential services are being provided, but that non-essential travel is not taking place. Beyond that, the Chief Public Health Officer again continues to brief all of the Ministers, and, as I understand, will be looking to brief the House, all the Members on the rise of the House, about any ongoing developments. Things are changing rapidly, but, at the same time, there are people who are responding to them rapidly. It is a bit difficult to do so, certainly, when we are all sitting here together, but I do have faith that that is happening even while we are here. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
2020-05-13 10:15:52,823 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. LAFFERTY: As it stands, obviously, we would like to follow what the Chief Medical Officer recommends, and I understand that she has stated that she doesn't have the authority to stop this from happening, people coming from the South. It is this government that is responsible, and we have had experience with PDAC participants who came back and there are some issues. This is becoming a pandemic, as it has been called. We have people coming in from the South. We don't know where they have been, but they are it bringing into the Northwest Territories. Not only the Northwest Territories, but small and isolated communities. We have a lack of health professionals, so I am very worried about my community, the Wekweeti and Gameti small communities. Is there a plan in place to deal with that matter immediately? Because we are saying, "Well, we are allowing self-isolation, if that needs to be the case," but we are just allowing them to do that on their own cases. It is optional. As a government, are we dealing with this particular matter?

CAROLINE WAWZONEK: Yes, the small communities and the needs of small communities have been at the heart and at the center of a lot of the considerations that have gone into the planning that is under way. I know that there are going to be some differences. Hesitancy now isn't the lack of a plan. Hesitancy is that I want to ensure that I am speaking with the most current information on behalf of all the departments.

2020-05-13 10:15:52,825 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — Obviously, the House is aware that, right now, our Premier is actually on a phone call with the Prime Minister and other first Ministers. It would be helpful, I think, to know what has been discussed in that conversation, and it would be helpful certainly to check back in with all the departments and our Public Health Officer, as they have been meeting this morning and taking steps to ensure that they are doing everything they need to. Because there hasn't been a confirmed case in the Northwest Territories, and so we want to ensure that there is not a confirmed case in the Northwest Territories, as a result of which our Chief Public Health Officer has been taking an approach that is directed at achieving that goal. That, Mr. Speaker, is why, if there is a sense of us not speaking fully, it is because we want to speak clearly and correctly and accurately with the most up-to-date information. 
2020-05-13 10:15:52,826 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — Again, Mr. Speaker, the fact that we have small communities who have less healthcare infrastructure than the larger centres, that has been something that I know I have personally raised when I have been on the national calls with my colleagues, and I believe they have been raised by the colleagues in Cabinet with their colleagues, that we need to take those considerations very seriously. I simply want to assure the Member that, as soon as I have the current up-to-date plan and information, we will share that with the House and get that information out to the public. 
2020-05-13 10:15:52,826 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. LAFFERTY: I am just trying to get the points across so I can share them with my constituents, as well. People who have been texting and messaging us. People who are coming from the South. To be self-isolated, is it optional, or is it mandatory from our perspective, the government's perspective?

CAROLINE WAWZONEK: At this point, it's still a recommendation that anyone coming back into the Northwest Territories would consider their own symptomology and determine whether or not they need to self-isolate. That is still the recommendation. Indeed, there have been media releases on a national level only just this morning about travel that is coming back internationally and recommending that anyone returning internationally, I believe, is being recommended, indeed, to self-isolate. They're being a bit more aggressive here in the Northwest Territories about travel coming in from elsewhere in Canada, as well, but the latest information that I have is that that was still a recommendation.

I will continue to update the House, and we will continue, all of us, to update the public in due course.

I need to know if the Emergency Measures Act that was updated by the last Assembly to the GNWT overhauled its emergency plan, besides the planning that is underway right now to give the residents of the Northwest Territories, especially the small communities that we represent, direction on how the government is handling this outbreak. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. To the Deputy Premier.

The novel coronavirus, COVID-19, has been declared, as we are aware, a pandemic by the World Health Organization, and requires enhanced public health and emergency preparedness. The Member is asking: what is the government doing to prepare? The GNWT has a territorial planning committee which is leading a broader, all-of-government approach emergency response planning to address potential disruptions and essential community, regional, and territorial services and support.

2020-05-13 10:15:54,299 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — The Health and Social Services emergency operations centre has been fully activated to permit the Health and Social Services system to coordinate rapid planning in advance of a Northwest Territories outbreak. The chief medical public health officer is leading the public health preparations and surveillance and providing subject matter expertise to the Health and Social Services system and the GNWT on pandemic planning requirements. The NWT COVID-19 pandemic planning guide and checklist is guiding the Health and Social Services system preparations. The Health and Social Services authorities are planning for a surge in cases that may affect regular delivery of health services. Decisions around deferring the delivery of non-essential health services may be made as necessary. Staff have received fresher training on infectious disease protocols. The Northwest Territories receives routine updates from the Canadian public health office officials on suspected and confirmed cases reported in other parts of Canada and the world. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

The department will continue to share information necessary for their planning efforts. The local and regional authorities, governments, agencies, and businesses should be finalizing emergency readiness plans in light of the potential for a COVID-19 outbreak. An outbreak in the Northwest Territories could impact community services and may increase the need for basic supplies, as well as water delivery, sewage pump-out, and facilities to the homes. Organizers of these events and gatherings should assess their plans, recognizing that this is an evolving situation that may require rapid decisions to protect the health and well-being of our residents here in the Northwest Territories. We know that community members will band together and support each other in the event that COVID-19 reaches their community.

There are any number of projects that are constantly being evaluated across the Northwest Territories, and it's not that one takes precedence over another. There are a number of factors that go into evaluating these projects and a number of factors that go into evaluating which projects are supported. Ultimately, this particular project, I understand that money was sought from the National Trade Corridors Fund, and that kind of funding would support and assist in moving this project forward. As far as any specific reason why that project might have been denied or put down on the list, I would have to get back on the Member on that, other than to say that there is a recognition that there is any number of projects that would all like to be advanced. We are going to simply have to distribute those resources to one project at a time sometimes. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

We are pleased that the federal government has announced this funding. We have heard from the federal Minister of Health that this funding is just the beginning of support which is great because that is not a lot of money. We are currently working to identify areas where funding can support us and how much we will need to do this. Officials in my department are working to prepare a list of our needs and finalizing proposals, and we are expected to complete this by tomorrow. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

As a result of that, we are not planning on closing down any public institution. However, as a precautionary measure, our government is enhancing surveillance for the COVID-19 to include those individuals who present flu-like symptoms within 14 days, or have travelled outside the Northwest Territories. The best precautions, however, are what we've been communicating. If you are sick, stay home. If you have flu-like symptoms, stay home. Monitor yourself. Practice safe hygiene and respiratory practices.

CAROLINE WAWZONEK: I am not in a position to say what the police priority action plans will be that are developed between the RCMP and a specific community, but again, I can certainly look at the policing priorities that are developed on the Ministerial level. Then we'll certainly have engagement again with our RCMP and to speak to them about the concerns that are being raised. I am confident that, when they go through their own process with the community, it is a direct engagement. I have asked them in the past about that process and sought assurance that they are developing their community policing action plans in a timely fashion and with direct engagement from the community. I will continue to have those conversations with the RCMP, and I am confident that, certainly, from the detachment level, they also recognize the importance of that direct community engagement. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

2020-05-13 10:15:54,444 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MS. GREEN: Mahsi, Mr. Speaker. My questions are for the Minister of Justice. As I said in my statement, the Yukon government is piloting a program to train Indigenous people to write Gladue reports. The purpose of the report is to inform the court of the background and circumstances of an Indigenous offender so that courts have consistent information when considering sentencing. My question is: has the Minister given any thought to funding a report-writing program like the one being piloted in the Yukon? Thank you.

Yes, we have given thought, and I have personally given thought, to whether or not we can fund that. As the Member is aware, Gladue report-writing's purpose is to provide better information to the courts so that they can make better decisions in a way that respect somebody's Indigenous heritage but also respects, sometimes, the systemic issues that impact an individual when they come before the courts. The ultimate purpose of that, Mr. Speaker, is to reduce the over-incarceration of Indigenous people in Canadian prisons, particularly in Northwest Territories prisons. Ultimately, while having given thought to whether or not this is a direction we want to go, at this time, our focus is on other ways of actually achieving that same goal and putting those resources towards achieving that same goal in other ways. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

During the course of that, one of the priorities that we have that has been a personal priority for me is to achieve some movement in terms of the overrepresentation of Indigenous people in prisons. There are ways of doing that by increasing our community engagement; by increasing community justice programming; by looking to diversion programs; by truly avoiding people going into the jail system in the first place; by, for example, reducing the amount of people who are in remand. There are a number of levers that we can pull, and those are all going to be levers that we are looking to to see what changes we can make both quickly but also systemically over time.

These are in addition to the fact that the board hasn't actually been asked to resolve any disputes in seven years.

The issue with going through the commercial lease process is that you cannot live on a commercial lease. If you're going to farm, you should probably live there. My question is: is the Minister willing to review the commercial leasing process to see if agricultural people can live on the land?

In the long term, we don't allow that, but in the present, what we are encouraging people to do is to actually apply for residential leases besides the commercial lease for the land so that they can live beside the land right now. We are in the process of trying to work on it, and the process takes some time.

JOHNSON: I don't often like to refer to the Yukon as doing things better than us, but I can tell you what a proper agricultural land system looks like. In the Yukon, if you live on a piece of land for seven years, they give it to you for free in fee simple. It's not a lease; you get to own that land if you're willing to put it to agricultural use. Now, I think this is, perhaps, too much to ask the Department of Lands to look at something like that, but when we are looking at agricultural leases, can we look at the pricing and make this as cheap as possible for those willing to start agricultural businesses?

We also have land claims processes, so we have to remember to respect Indigenous rights as we move forward. However, in hearing the Member speak about this and that, we are actually working on that. We are trying to make that part of the regulations. We are dealing with it. Presently, I would just like to point out that raw land is already low. It's at $800 per hectare for territorial land; 5 percent of assessed value for Commissioner's land. Again, like I said, pricing for the review of this process will be part of our Public Land Act and regulations.

I have the Ingraham Trail on it, and I have no shortage of constituents complaining about the Department of Lands and the lack of planning and the mishap way that we have rolled out leases in that area.

We had looked at it, and using private counsellors would be extremely expensive; for example, two, possibly three, times the cost for employing our own counsellors. Our approach to reducing wait times is the Seamless Care Pathway, that we are making sure people are matched with the right level of service to ensure more timely access. What I am aware of, in reading my briefings and meeting with staff, is that the wait times for counselling do not exist in most communities. Wait times are mainly an issue in Yellowknife and Hay River.

I do want to expand that a main part of this work is to improve access to counselling by adding same-day walk-in appointments, as well as other options, like e-mental health access. These types of efforts have been shown to have dramatic impacts on wait times in other areas of the country. This work is underway as we speak and is on track to be implemented this spring 2020.

I feel that I have acknowledged that the cost is high to work with private contractors, but when you have a high suicide rate like we do in the Northwest Territories, that cost is much higher. The risk of losing more youth to suicide in communities or in Yellowknife is, you can't put a number on that. I am thankful that the department is looking at it, but I feel that I disagree with the Minister here, that we do have wait times and having a child identify that they are suicidal and waiting three weeks to three months is not okay to receive mental healthcare. I'm wondering if the Minister will commit to working with NTHSSA to identify a responsive triage mechanism that allows us to see Northerners in a much quicker manner and would potentially review that process with collaboration from Members on this side of the House. Thank you.

Our approach to reducing wait times in the Seamless Care Pathway, we are working to make sure that people are matched with the right level of service to ensure more timely access. The goal of this is to improve access to mental health services, but it's also focused on how we match people to their services. The Seamless Care Pathway approach is about offering the service that best meets the needs of the person. This program is overseen by the Department of Finance; oh, sorry. No. It's our department.

The other thing we should be looking at, as well, is: we do have businesses out there who do have loans from government lenders, and we could look at the interest rates. We could also look at deferring the payments during this period. The third one is: we have to make sure that any businesses are being paid in a timely manner. They can't be waiting for payments for the work they've done. I'd just like to get a commitment from whoever wants to answer it, I guess, that Cabinet will look at that.

A lot of the governments across Canada right now are introducing budgets right now or are about to do so, so in some ways, it's good timing. We're at the early stage of our fiscal year; we have a lot of flexibility. We have the flexibility to respond, and we will be able to do that. We will be able to keep this House and all the Members appraised of what we are doing and how we are doing it as we become more aware of what the information is and what the impacts are. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

We offer trades courses at Aurora College here. There is more emphasis being put on the trades at the high school level. Our career development, it's a different name. The officials from ECE go into the schools and talk to the students, and tell them about other career opportunities. They are having those conversations with students now, saying that trades is a career that you can get into. That type of work needs to happen more and more. I know, for a long time, trades was sort of a secondary consideration, but the fact is it's good work.

2020-05-13 10:15:56,042 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — Over the past couple number of years, the labour numbers in the NWT have gone down, but the number of self-employed people has actually gone up, has increased by 500, and trade is a perfect way to become self-employed. There's always work if you are a tradesperson. There are a number of programs. I won't go through them all right now. I'll let the Member ask some more questions because I might just answer them all if I keep going on. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
2020-05-13 10:15:56,043 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. NORN: Well, I'm glad that his department is going into schools and promoting trades.

2020-05-13 10:15:56,044 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. R.J. SIMPSON: One of the things that ECE is committing to doing is creating a blue seal certification program for journeymen or journeypersons. This is something that exists in other jurisdictions, and what it is is the technical aspect of being a journeyperson plus a business component. This is something that requires that the people who get the certification have those business skills. It's an additional thing that people can strive for. There is also the ECE self-employment program, in which the department will work with clients to help support their business idea. There is funding for courses to attend training, for books, for tools, for travel. ECE will help facilitate meetings with BDIC as the Member mentioned earlier, and they can help come up with a business plan. If someone is committed to starting their own business, whether it be trades or anything else, there are programs that are available. I can provide more detailed information to the Member, as well.

NORN: Just to give a little context on this one here, I used to work for Diavik and for the community's department, and we used to go to places like Wekweeti and Whati and stuff. I remember going to school. We were trying to explain trades to very young grades, and we couldn't get through to them. Finally, I said, "You know, I think I have a good example." I told a grade 6 term, "You know how, in Star Wars, there's Jedi's? You don't just become a Jedi overnight. You have to become a Padawan first. You have to train under somebody, and then you become one. That's how trades works."

2020-05-13 10:15:56,046 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — I guess, on that note, I want to know what the Minister is doing to promote trades in our schools, in grade school?
2020-05-13 10:15:56,047 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. R.J. SIMPSON:. As I mentioned earlier, we have the career and education advisors. What they do is they have those conversations with students, starting at grade 7, so it's not quite as early as the Member is speaking about, but they start letting kids know about their options early on so that those students can then make sure they're taking the right courses to get where they need to be. We also have the SNAP program, which is something that's available all over the territory, although it does take some partnerships; it's not something you can just roll out. There are a number of things like that, and, like I said, we just need to do a better job, and I'm working on this myself, in promoting the trades. Trades are great occupations. I don't really like to have a boss, necessarily, and, if you have a trade, you can be your own boss. Always, that work is always needed. You can work in a big company. You can work on your own. You can work in a small community. You can work anywhere. Trades are great opportunities, and we really need to get that word out there and make sure that we are guiding the students who want to go down that path down that path.

I spoke frequently in the last Assembly about the benefits of involving third parties in sexual assault reporting and oversight of police sexual assault investigations. I believe that these initiatives will allow us to provide better services to survivors and to get a better idea of barriers to reporting and resolving cases.

2020-05-13 10:15:56,064 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. CAROLINE WAWZONEK: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The Member has already alerted me previously to the fact that there is a report produced on this matter in June and that NGOs and stakeholders met at that time. Since then, Mr. Speaker, there's been some update, which is that the RCMP continue to engage with the proposed review committee and that, meanwhile, the GNWT Department of Justice is also putting forward a second meeting of the same stakeholders to review progress with respect to having the NGO group come together. So I say all that, Mr. Speaker, because the degree of support or program develop that will result will depend very much on what happens at these subsequent meetings, when we hear back from these same stakeholders, to determine exactly how they want to see this program unfold and that that will then better inform my ability to stand up in the House and explain the nature of the program as it goes forward. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

2020-05-13 10:15:56,075 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MS. GREEN: Thank you to the Minister for that answer. What we are proposing here for the Northwest Territories isn't new. It's not even new in Canada. There is third-party reporting in place in the Yukon. There is third-party oversight of police files available in Ontario. It is my understanding that the RCMP has already done the preliminary work to make this happen. Given that landscape is already fairly well formed, what are the barriers to implementing these changes in the Northwest Territories?

2020-05-13 10:15:56,076 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. CAROLINE WAWZONEK: There are two different things that are at issue. First, with respect to third-party reporting, that certainly would provide another avenue of reporting, another way in which victims can come forward, and arguably in a way that would provide some flexibility and alternatives when people may not be in a position, for whatever reason, to attend the RCMP. That said, the model that is being looked at at present involves non-governmental organizations or victim service providers who are not necessarily GNWT employees, so, of course, we need to ensure that those individuals or those organizations have the capacity to deliver the training and capacity to then deliver any kind of services in order to perform the function of third-party reporting. I certainly don't want to underestimate what that might entail or assume that those agencies would have the ability to take that on. We would want to ensure that either they have that capacity or that we are able to support them in developing that capacity.

However, wanting to work with our  RCMP partners to ensure that, when this is happening or if there's going to be third-party oversight, that that is done in a way that is respectful of their operational processes.
2020-05-13 10:15:56,078 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MS. GREEN: I appreciate the Minister is being cautious, but the fact is that the stakeholders who were at the special meeting in June of last year were uniformly in favour of these initiatives, recognizing that there were some issues to be sorted out. What I'd like a sense of from the Minister is how long it's going to take to work through the considerations that she has named in order to put these services in place.

CAROLINE WAWZONEK: I understand that the next round of stakeholder engagement is actually scheduled to take place in April of this year, so only just next month. At that point, there will be a review of what work has been done so far, what programs have been undertaken to this point. At that point, if in fact the various NGOs and stakeholders, victim services providers, and organizations are able to say that they can roll out and move forward, I would anticipate that there won't be a stop put in place, but the Department of Justice would be there to support their provision of those services. We do need to hear back from them, being partners in these programs. As I say, I expect that that's going to take place next month.

2020-05-13 10:15:56,081 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MS. GREEN: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you to the Minister for that. I just want to point out what a glacial pace this is moving at. I've spoken about it for, say, three years, and the consultation happened in June, and the follow-up is happening in April, so I really am concerned about when this is actually going to happen. I wonder if it makes sense for the government to put out an RFP for a service provider and work specifically with the respondents to that RFP in order to launch the service, rather than doing more consultation and then moving on to an RFP at some other point?

2020-05-13 10:15:56,093 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. CAROLINE WAWZONEK: I had been hoping that I could simply say that I would commit to get back to the Member with the results from April. I am more hesitant to say that I'm going to put out an RFP based on the fact that I don't know what the reports of the pilot will say. That said, as I've said, the GNWT doesn't want to hold this back. If the stakeholders are in support and they are able to undertake the project and to continue it forward, the GNWT is not going to stop third-party reporting from moving forward under those circumstances. I think the best that I could perhaps do for today is to say that if, in fact, the reporting comes back and the pilots come back as being positive and that there is capacity to move this forward, then, at that point, the matter will move forward and it will move forward in a fashion that is timely, keeping in mind that we have June session where, if I haven't issued an RFP or if the department hasn't issued an RFP, then, by that stage, I would expect the Member to be asking me questions again, and hopefully it would be much easier to commit. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

2020-05-13 10:15:56,110 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. JOHNSON: I appreciate that answer. The importance here is that carbon offset pools are increasingly becoming a more and more common, larger pool of money to tap into. The federal government is looking at setting up a credit scheme nation-wide, and I don't want the Northwest Territories to be left behind. One of my concerns with this is that it's not really built into our energy strategy or our climate change strategy, so I want to make sure that we look into this properly. Can the Minister work with her counterparts in Infrastructure and ENR and make sure there are some clearer points of accountability for who is responsible, ultimately, for the many aspects of carbon offsets?

Climate change is a project that is receiving collaboration from a real whole-of-government approach. Many departments are involved, and that is a positive thing. It's bringing together the many different facets of this issue. I acknowledge the Member's point and the challenge he is having asking questions of Cabinet, and so I would certainly commit to ensuring that there is a clear point of accountability that can answer to all of these different facets, or that I can direct to Member to which aspect of the collaboration will respond to questions. I will make sure that that is communicated.
2020-05-13 10:15:56,113 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. JOHNSON: I appreciate that answer, and I recognize that this is a new area, but I think carbon offsets and carbon trading are only going to get bigger and they are only going to become a greater source of revenue for the Northwest Territories and green projects. I'm happy to hear that we are working with the Minister of Environment and Climate Change Canada to make sure we have input into that carbon credit scheme that's being developed nation-wide, so I guess my question to the Minister of Finance is: can we direct the staff who are doing that to make sure that the priorities of the North, and perhaps a carve-out for northern credits and our unique situation, are reflected and we advocate for that in that policy?

It allows remission forgiveness in property tax interest in return for a person making a payment on the principal that is owed. Will the Minister have her department develop a similar program with the arrears and forgiveness of debt, money put on, and they will get some of their arrears freed? Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

At that point, it will have to go to Cabinet for approval, and then a bill will have to be drafted, which will then have go back to Cabinet for approval. At that point, it will be brought into this House and the Legislative Assembly will take hold of the bill. This process could be done. We could see the introduction in the May-June sitting, if we hear back from the standing committee soon enough and if it goes through all those steps.

In terms of Aurora College in particular, I've been in talks with the department regarding the childcare situation there. I think everyone is aware of that, everyone in this House anyway. I know that in Fort Smith there is a deficit in terms of childcare, as there is in many places.

One thing I have noticed here in the territories is that some of the communities have access for accommodation for people during the winter who have nowhere to go, but not all communities have that. I am just wondering if the Minister has a plan to address this situation for next winter because, in Hay River, we are going to have to deal with it. We have dealt with it internally within the community with assistance from the people of Hay River, from local businesses from Hay River, and non-profits from Hay River, with no cost to the government. I am just wondering if the Minister has any idea what her department is going to do for next winter, for looking after that situation, homelessness in the NWT. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

I know the department has a lot of work to do regarding the Property Assessment and Taxation Act, which ultimately ties into the city charter issue. My concern is that the municipalities have been asking for the Property Assessment and Taxation Act to be brought forward for over a decade, and the department has been very slow to do so. I don't want to be standing here in a decade, asking about a Yellowknife city charter. Would the Minister be willing to reach out to the City of Yellowknife and get them to provide what they would see as a process going forward for a Yellowknife city charter?

I can tell you the reason that the City of Yellowknife has asked for this is because they find dealing with the Department of Municipal and Community Affairs extremely frustrating. I am happy to finally see the Property Assessment and Taxation Act coming forward. There is a number of unique things that we can do in Yellowknife, whether it be municipal bonds, local services, vacancy taxes, that simply just would not make sense in the smaller communities and may not even make sense in the other tax-based communities. So, during the development of the Property Assessment and Taxation Act, is the Minister willing to reach out to the City of Yellowknife and hear some of their concerns around property assessment and the unique needs of the City of Yellowknife?

This funding is meant to support the Indigenous governments to provide the same type of mobile addictions treatment program as for the Salt River First Nation that they delivered a couple years ago. It is our hope that this type of program can be a real option for individuals who do not want to leave their community.

I can confirm that, under the agricultural strategy, these discussions are ongoing in the departments at the working-group level. We also are trying to be more proactive with communities when it comes to designating land for agricultural use. Over the last two years, ITI's superintendent in the South Slave has met with community leaders, is my understanding, to identify lands within the municipalities for agriculture. In Hay River, in particular, this is a really opportune time, as the town itself is undertaking its community development planning. We are going to definitely be working with them.

Food, clothing, and shelter are, according to Maslow's hierarchy, the basic needs that we need to meet for people; so when I hear that almost 3,400 people, my understanding is, are feeling insecure about their food, that brings concerns. It should bring concerns for all of our governments. What are we doing about it?

2020-05-13 10:15:57,996 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — We do have things that we are working on, a range of activities, from increasing local food production to, of course, our agricultural industry that was just spoken about earlier today. Our territorial Anti-Poverty Action Plan includes 12 actions on food security, including the establishment of a food security coalition for the NWT, so we will be moving forward on this action plan, as well. Then, of course, we are looking to work with the Government of Canada, constantly working with the Government of Canada, to get some input into the redesign of our Nutrition North. I have heard for many years that that is not working. It's time for the Government of Canada to hear us and make a Nutrition North program that more works for the Northwest Territories. 
2020-05-13 10:15:57,997 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. O'REILLY: I want to thank the Premier for that response. It was 3,400 households, not individuals; it's a lot more individuals who are worried about food. Mr. Speaker, without a proper tracking system to account for local food production and consumption, it seems unlikely that there will be any measurable progress towards building stronger food security. Can the Premier tell us whether there is indeed a proper tacking system in place for food security in the NWT, and if not, will she commit her Cabinet to developing one?

2020-05-13 10:15:57,998 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. CAROLINE COCHRANE: The Member knows that, actually, the NWT Bureau of Statistics does track food prices in the larger regional centres, such as Yellowknife, Hay River, et cetera. They also, every few years, do a comparison across the communities, and from that, a food price index is calculated. It shows variations in the price of food across the communities. The question on whether we would track further than that, that is a question that, at this point, I am not willing to actually make a commitment to. It's one thing to be able to track how many people might start an egg-producing farm or a large-scale farm. How many people actually have greenhouses in their backyard, such as myself? Those would be impossible to track, but those are really important food initiatives that people have to take in the Northwest Territories. I grew up here in 1962, and I couldn't even grow grass; I never knew we used to have farming here. It's an initiative that we have to push further. We need to look at food production in all areas, whether it's in harvesting to growing your own crops. However, to be able to take numbers on all of that, like I said, the backyard farmers, it would be a little bit more difficult.

2020-05-13 10:15:58,028 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — Building food security is going to take a lot of effort from this government, and it's going to cut across many departments. For example, food security can and should include greater support for community harvesters and local food production. Can the Premier tell us what the best programs are to support community harvesting and local food production and whether these will be increased over the next four years? 
2020-05-13 10:15:58,029 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. CAROLINE COCHRANE: I cannot stand here and say what the best program is. What I can say is that we have a variety of programs across the departments. For example, our anti-poverty fund gives $1 million a year in contributions; last year, in 2019-2020, we supported 31 food security projects. Our healthy children's fund provides $400,000 a year; that gave a total of seven security projects through this fund. Thirteen food security projects were supported through the Small Community Homelessness Fund. The Healthy Food for Learning program, and this is one is a big one for me, supports all 49 schools in the Northwest Territories for healthy foods for children. The Canadian Agricultural Partnership is a federal partnership; it gives a million dollars a year to advance community food development. ITI has the Northern Food Development Program to support producers of fish, meat, and other food products. We are revitalizing the Great Slave Lake fishery; I think that is an important one. The Sustainable Livelihoods Action Plan supports land-based initiatives, including harvesting. We have a Community Harvesters Assistance Program, and we are looking at a mentorship program, as well. As well, the Indigenous governments asked for a hunter education program to support safe hunting.

My questions are to the health Minister regarding concerns raised by local residents of the health centre. Mr. Speaker, I've raised this issue with the Minister on February 27, 2020, on the same issue: the issues that residents are having with nurse practitioners at the local health centre. This continues to be a serious issue. Residents want action, and they want action now. Can the Minister provide assurances to the residents of Fort Providence that this issue can be looked to as soon as possible? Mahsi.

I, myself, have filed a complaint on behalf of several residents back in November 2019. There has been no action on this file, no notices or acknowledgments that they were received from that association.

One of my concerns is that they're going out and doing this work right now, and I don't want to get left behind where, all of a sudden, we're not caught up to make sure we can implement this change. I guess what I'm looking for is: is the Minister of Justice prepared to commit that, should Alberta change and get rid of the time zone, we will do so as well?

We will reach out to stakeholders such as airlines, such as computer service providers. As far as public engagement, I think I would be a little more hesitant there in that that can mean a lot of different things depending on the nature of the bill. This change would involve a change to regulations. This is not a change that requires a legislative change; it is the Daylight Savings Time Regulations, I think, I'm not sure if that's quite right, so it's a fairly narrow change that would need to take place. That doesn't necessarily or typically require public engagement, but, to the extent that there are stakeholders and relevant stakeholders that we need to engage with, yes, I will commit to making that motion now.

For example, there was additional training provided in January of 2020, so already this year, surrounding the kinds of responses that should be taking place. There have been discussions within Corrections and in the workplace, specifically around when and how to review policy and about refresher training, which does happen regularly within the facility. In addition to that, being aware of the need to be particularly responsive to what is a very difficult workplace, there has, in fact, now been an inter-departmental working group formed with human resources and Corrections to ensure that we're providing the very best staffing and staffing support to our front line, but also to the supervisors within the facility.

The video, which is the information I have to go on, raises a whole bunch of questions. Why didn't the guard on the other side of the door intervene? Why did the guard on this side of the door not have another guard with her? There are many questions that this video raises, which there are no written answers to, in terms of publicly accessible information, or even through ATIP. My question, which I want to repeat again, is about serious incident protocols. I'm sure that the correctional centre has them, and I'm interested to know whether they were followed in this case. Thank you.

That policy has been the subject of review, and that has been the subject of review by the staff and by the supervisors at the facility. I am confident, going forward, that they have looked at that, that they have looked at that policy specifically, and that the things that we've done since then, including training in January, including the inter-departmental working group to support the staff, and hopefully, also with the workplace assessment that is coming in the next month or so, that any shortcomings in terms of following policy will not be repeated and that, indeed, policies will be at the very best possible level to ensure the safety of all the people who are working at the correctional facility. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

Some examples are injections for migraines, also the skin surveys, as well as allergy testing. These are some of the areas where our department is looking at efficiencies, as well as we continue to work with our telehealth care to reduce the need for patient to travel outside the community.

That is a separate issue that the City of Yellowknife is not requesting that land. My next question is: I am concerned that we underfund our municipalities, and they have been asking for this land. I am concerned that the Department of Lands is then going to make the city pay an arm and a leg for it. My question is for the Minister of Lands: is there an intention to charge the city for this land?

I had confirmed quite specifically that it was an external contractor, external to the Department of Justice, but I don't have the name. I will have to confirm that. I would expect that it would come back to me. As far as releasing it thereafter, I would first of all need to know the extent of it. To the extent that it's a specific HR matter, I would be hesitant to release names that are involving HR. To the extent that it's a broader assessment, I expect that that can much more generally be released to the relevant committee. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

2020-05-13 10:15:58,247 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MS. GREEN: I appreciate the answer from the Minister. I just want to inform the Minister that, in times gone by, we have received reports confidentially as a standing committee, and we've committed to keeping those reports confidential. I am concerned, in the meantime, about the safety of the staff in the North Slave Correctional Centre. The findings from that report into the incident last May suggest that the guard may not have been aware of the protocol he wasn't following, and he put himself into a very unsafe situation. My question for the Minister is: what specific additional measures can Corrections management take to keep their front-line staff safe?

2020-05-13 10:15:58,248 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. CAROLINE WAWZONEK: I certainly share the view that making sure that all staff at Corrections facilities across the Northwest Territories are safe is critical. I certainly am aware of the need to do that and aware of the challenges of working in the Corrections environment. I have seen and am aware from just my involvement in the correctional area that this is something that we need to be constantly vigilant about. Leaving aside this specific incident and the specific individuals involved, when I assumed this role, it was something that I was alive to and did, indeed, take action to establish the inter-departmental working group between Human Resources and Corrections in order to ensure that appropriate training is unfolding; that tracking of training, both in terms of the correctional side of training, as well as mental wellness and wellness generally, are all taking place within the facility. There is now a work plan for that working group. They are looking at appropriate training for people within Corrections. They are assuring me that, indeed, tools and resources have been developed and are being developed that look at, within correctional institutions, mental wellness and wellness generally are going to be available and, more specifically, that there is going to be Corrections-relevant training worked in that has a northern context and northern relevance. That is going to be part of all training delivered for new recruits going forward in the Northwest Territories.

That is a growing concern. I am assured, somewhat fortunately, although there is work to be done, that Corrections staff are engaged on a national level with their counterparts to consider this issue, to consider what can be done to better support Corrections staff in the Northwest Territories and in Canada generally, knowing that this is something that has become a bigger and bigger issue, and we are going to need to take steps to deal with it.

Income Assistance Issues
2020-05-13 10:15:59,771 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — New oral question.
2020-05-13 10:15:59,772 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. O'REILLY: Merci, Monsieur le President. My questions are for the Minister of Education, Culture and Employment, who is also responsible for Income Security programs. I spoke in my statement of a number of issues. I see from the Education, Culture and Employment website that there is an updated Income Assistance policy manual dated October 2019. Although the Social Assistance Appeals Regulations require that an officer inform clients in writing of their entitlement appeal, I see no reference to this in the manual or in the correspondence that has been provided to me. Can the Minister tell us whether the department routinely informs clients in writing of their rights when it comes to Income Security programs? Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

2020-05-13 10:15:59,781 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. R.J. SIMPSON: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Earlier, the Member referenced the ATIPP legislation that requires a notice of appeal and appeal rights. The Social Assistance Act Income Assistance Appeals Regulations also contain a provision. It's Section 4(1), I believe, so that is mandated that that has to be done. That is done. I have a copy here of the notice of refusal, which clearly indicates that there are appeal rights. The handbook the Member references, I believe there is an updated policy manual. It's February 2020, and I checked that today, and that does make that reference, although the plain-language handbook might not be as clear, but I will look into that.

2020-05-13 10:15:59,782 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. O'REILLY: I want to thank the Minister for that. I can assure him, though, that, from the correspondence I have seen from my constituents, the appeal rights are not mentioned, so I would ask that the Minister investigate some of the actual correspondence Income Assistance recipients receive when they are refused, and so on. I want to move on. I have repeatedly mentioned the need to index our Income Security programs. That includes Income Assistance, Student Financial Assistance, seniors and other benefits, and those should be indexed, Mr. Speaker, to the cost of living. Forced growth is the norm elsewhere, so I do not believe that our most disadvantaged people should be left behind. Can the Minister commit to indexing of Income Security payments through changes to regulations and/or legislation to help the most vulnerable members of our society?

2020-05-13 10:15:59,793 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. R.J. SIMPSON: First, I just want to address the Member's comments. If any Member is aware of incidents where we are not living up to our standards, please let me know. We have a system in place within the actual offices, but I want to work toward a territory-wide tracking system so that we can identify these types of concerns and move to improve them. In terms of indexing, Income Assistance does pay the actual cost of shelter, of utilities, and of heating fuel, so, in that sense, it is indexed. However, at this time, I can't commit to indexing all of the benefits. We look at our mandate, and ECE has a lot in that mandate, and so, over this next year, we are going to be looking at how we can achieve that. There are going to be some tough financial decisions that we have to make, and so I cannot stand up here and say that we are going to make the decisions that the Member is asking for.

2020-05-13 10:15:59,794 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. O'REILLY: I want to thank the Minister for that. It was not quite a "yes," but, look, I am talking about the most disadvantaged people in our society. We need take care of them, as we can and should do. I mentioned in my earlier statement the problems when Income Assistance recipients find themselves in situations where they lose jobs or they maybe lose their housing. It's a vicious cycle. I would like to know if there is any consideration that is being given to repayment plans, like rental arrears plans, to reduce hardships of drastic benefit reductions?

2020-05-13 10:15:59,795 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. R.J. SIMPSON: I have spoken about this at length in the House. Right now, there are repayment plans if you receive an overpayment. However, the Member is correct. If someone starts working, their benefits are cut off because they are over the threshold, and then, if they lose their job, that could create immediate financial hardship or the cut-off could result in them having to pay thousands of dollars in rent and utilities and fuel, if it's in the middle of winter, and they might not be able to afford that, so I have committed to looking into the possibility of phasing benefits out. That is a long-term discussion. It would take a lot of research. It would take legislative changes, but I have committed to this House that I am looking into that kind of stuff.

I think he is the right guy to do it. I supported the previous Minister when she conducted an administrator review of Income Security programs. They resulted in some important changes, but what we really need is a systematic approach to change. An example of that is guaranteed basic income, or at least a pilot project around guaranteed basic income. Has the Minister or his department considered a guaranteed basic income pilot project in the NWT, and when is he prepared to make that happen?

The work that it would take to actually look into this and do the research is not doable, given what we have been mandated to do by this Assembly. Successive governments over the past number of decades have gone through cuts. The people to get cut are the policy people. We are pretty thin on policy positions. It is tough to do a lot of the work that we want to do. I am not even sure how we are going to do the things that we are mandated to do and that this Assembly is asking of us. To take on a project of this magnitude, I just can't do it at this point. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

What I was referencing in my previous answer was the fact that there has been some work done, but the work isn't finished yet. It is still being developed. There is much more to come. What I will do is, as I say, I will connect with the Member specifically. If I need to bring something back as a result of those discussions to the House with some specific numbers, I will do that.

2020-05-13 10:15:59,834 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MS. GREEN: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. My questions are for the Minister of Health and Social Services. In my reply to the budget, I spoke about new information from the community survey, which reveals that one in five NWT households has trouble meeting its most basic needs, including access to sufficient food. The rates of moderate to severe food insecurity have increased over the years. My question to the Minister is: why does she think these rates continue to go up despite more direct and indirect spending by government? Thank you.

We had a meeting this week with the National Advisory Council on Poverty. During our meeting, we had some excellent discussions. These are 10 members across Canada who are dedicated, they are passionate, and they are knowledgeable. They are members from coast to coast to coast. We sat down and had an opportunity to talk about our anti-poverty work plan; it is the Working Together II. In there, we have identified a couple of key areas, especially food secure. The Working Together II has five pillars, and one of them references food security.

On-reserve funding through the national poverty strategy does not benefit the Northwest Territories. We also talked about food security and how important it is for us. I say important because it is one of our 22 priorities here. We will be addressing that in our budget. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

I look at this, and it is multi-departmental; Health and Social Services is not just the department that is responsible for poverty. Our meeting today included our Minister of Education, Culture and Employment. We also had our Minister of housing and Minister of Municipal and Community Affairs. Also, our Premier attended. It is not a one-department approach.

2020-05-13 10:15:59,851 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — I do want to talk about the action plan because here are some ideas, and the Member is asking for some ideas: increasing income support to elders with people with disabilities. I apologize to them and speak on some of the issues that are within each of the departments. I hope that's okay, but this is an action plan that we all have input and have a responsibility for; a commitment to make childcare more assessable across the Northwest Territories; funding to address homelessness in the smaller communities through Northern Pathways, which is a housing program, and also the supportive housing program. We also provide funding to support the Housing First program, the rapid housing program in Inuvik and Yellowknife. These support people who are either homeless or at risk of being homeless. Action to address food security throughout supports to harvesting and to agriculture. Community gardening is another project that, as a government, we all need to enforce. I am looking at ITI, because our Minister of ITI is also responsible for some of these projects in the Northwest Territories. 
2020-05-13 10:15:59,861 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MS. GREEN: I recognize that the new anti-poverty action plan is a multi-departmental plan. It is my understanding that it is in the leadership of the Minister of Health and Social Services. That is why I am asking her these questions today about food security. One of the things the anti-poverty action plan speaks to is creating a new food security coalition. Can the Minister tell us whether that work has started?

These are representatives from not only just the government, but also Indigenous governments, community governments, not-for-profit organizations, and this is something that we're establishing.

There is so much hunger; 2,271 youth and children under 15. We just can't ask them to wait two more years while we get to work on this. We need to start immediately. The final question I have is about the federal government's role in helping to reduce and eliminate food insecurity which, of course, they do through the Nutrition North program. My question is: what action is the Minister going to take with the federal government to improve the effectiveness of Nutrition North? Thank you.

That was not my intent, other than to let the Member know. I do want to go back to the Nutrition North program. The Nutrition North program is a federal program, and our department, we all meet together, and part of the development of the coalition is to come together and really reach out. We've already said, this government, we can't do things alone, and we can't do things in silos. We need to reach out and engage with the partners, Indigenous groups, and non-Indigenous groups. The more partners and key stakeholders that we have coming together, we will have a stronger approach to go towards the federal government for Nutrition North funding. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

My next question is: will the Department of Justice, or whoever the lead department is for this, commit to putting together an information resource that we can distribute to people to let them know what their options are for the next chapter of their lives that does not include domestic violence?

I've spoken to it at the Ministers' meetings that I've attended already thus far. I do know that the federal government has a strategy and they're in the midst of developing an action plan, and I expect that it would be prudent for us to at least see what progress there is made at a federal level to ensure that, if there is funding associated with whatever might be happening at that level, we can ensure that the identified departmental lead can then try to access that funding. There are still a few pieces moving at the moment. I need to see how they play out. Some of those will be put into motion, I believe, over the next month with respect to, first, working within our own departments, and second, knowing what the direction of the federal budget might be. Those two things might help us give direction as to how much we can achieve in terms of putting together an action plan. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

I want to ask some questions of the Minister of Finance, who also has responsibility for human resources. Most Canadian jurisdictions ensure that employees are provided with domestic violence leave, effective January 1, 2020. Our Employment Standards Act provides up to five days of paid family violence leave, another five days of unpaid leave, and maybe even 15 weeks of unpaid leave with proper notice. I supported these changes, but our main collective agreement with UNW only provides for three days of paid domestic violence leave. Is the Minister of aware of this difference in domestic violence leave for GNWT employees and other employees, and what action, if any, is she prepared to take to deal with these less-generous provisions for our employees?

2020-05-13 10:15:59,946 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. CAROLINE WAWZONEK: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The collective agreement does have a difference in it as compared to what is in the employment standards provisions, but it actually does also say that more than three days of leave can be approved by the employer and that the approval cannot be unreasonably denied. Certainly, we could take the step of at least reminding all of the GNWT that, indeed, one would not want to deny leave in circumstances when there is a case of domestic violence leave. If they have been given the three days and are requesting further, I would expect that, in many, many cases, it would be unreasonable to deny it. While it's worded differently, it's not quite as strict as that, and I certainly wouldn't want anyone to be discouraged, if they need leave, from going and speaking to their responsible supervisor to provide that information. As far as then changing the collective agreement, there will always be further bargaining and further negotiations that take place at new rounds of bargaining. If this is an issue that is seen by the employees, then we will see it at that point and deal with it in due course. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

That was not my intention, but certainly, simply to just point out again that more than three days of leave with pay will be approved by the employer, and that approval cannot be unreasonably denied. If it's a simple reminder of what the collective agreement says, and if that's not being applied, firstly, I would ask Members to bring that to my attention if it's not being applied, and there is no harm in reminding our own staff and our own supervisors what is in the agreement, so I am happy to certainly do that.

I am wondering if the Minister could commit to using the domestic leave provisions in the Employment Standards Act as a baseline when it comes to renegotiating the collective agreements. I am sure UNW would support more generous provisions. As I understand it, that's what they had pushed for at the bargaining table but couldn't achieve it. Again, will the Minister use the Employment Standards Act as the baseline moving forward in the negotiations of new collective agreements?

Do we have a threshold of when we are going to decide to go out and create our own action plan, or will we be patient and wait for the Canada-wide one?

Mr. Speaker, I recognize that this is a small issue, but it is my intention to go through each of my campaign platform points and try my best, and if I can't have an office buy a couple of hours, then I wonder what I am doing here. The Minister responsible for the Department of Infrastructure last said that one of the barriers to implementing this was cost. I would like to know what the cost would be in adding an additional day to the department of motor vehicles' operating hours.

To the entire cost of adding one extra day, versus moving days around, I don't have that number in front of me. However, it would be the staffing for at least one employee there for the hours. Then, there would be security needed, if that was on a weekend; so that's $22 per hour for security. There would also be issues with the HVAC systems. Buildings are turned off, generally, over weekends and in the evenings, so that would also be an additional cost to building maintenance that we would have to deal with. I am not sure if we would have to look at things like different types of pay rates for people working outside the regular 9:00 to 5:00 business hours, but I believe those would all be things that would add to the cost. If the Member would like, I could find out what one day of operating costs at the DMV are and supply that to him. Thank you.

Would the Minister be willing to also provide information on whether it would cost us money to have the department of motor vehicles be closed on Monday, but then open Saturday, which would allow us to have some hours which are not government hours?

I don't think it is as easy as just shutting down for Monday and opening up on Saturday, because there are, like I said, other ramifications to deal with having people in the building on a weekend when the rest of the building is not occupied. That includes, at this moment, the response team within the building, which does involve using staff that is in the building already who would, then, not be there on a weekend. Again, I will commit to the Member. We can give him a costing to change those hours, but I do believe it would be with a cost.

Will the Minister direct her department to open the department of motor vehicles in Yellowknife for some portion of time, either evenings or weekends?

2020-05-13 10:16:00,048 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. JOHNSON: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I previously had questions for the Minister of Infrastructure regarding a building standards act. One of the problems is that it's not quite clear who this responsibility would lie with. Consistent requests from the Northwest Territories Association of Communities, the Architects Association, and many Members have been directed towards the Department of Municipal and Community Affairs. My question to the Minister responsible for the Department of Municipal and Community Affairs is: will she direct her department to develop a legislative proposal for a building standards act in the Northwest Territories?

Working with a building standards act and trying to implement that in the Northwest Territories, I would have to be working with my colleagues. I know that we do not have one currently. We do use the fire act right now, that is up for review. I will speak with my department to see how we can work with this going forward because I know, looking at the building standards act, it's kind of complex. We deal with the fire regulations, the building codes, and this is all separate, and we don't have it actually located under one functioning act for the Northwest Territories. I will commit to the Member that I will be speaking to my department, and I will follow up with him with the results. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

2020-05-13 10:16:00,062 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. JOHNSON: I appreciate that commitment to bring this forward to the department to look into it. The main issue with a building standards act is we all know there is a multimillion-dollar deficit in infrastructure costs to the NWT, and GNWT infrastructure is built to very high-quality standards, but, in the communities where there is no enforcement of this, every single person building a building has to decide between quality, and often we are building buildings that are the cheaper option, which means that the cost of living in our communities consistently rises. A building standards act creates an even floor that allows us to have efficient costs for our residents, so my question to the Minister of Municipal and Community Affairs is: will she bring this issue to the Cabinet table to make sure that there is a clear department, whether it be Infrastructure, whether it be MACA, that is responsible, so that I know who to ask questions to regarding a building standards act?

Going back to my Member's statement, when I was talking about providing this type of traditional counselling in all of the regions, I understand that each Indigenous group may want something else. We have heard this, and we heard it again from the Premier when we were going through the mandate. This camp has Dene, Metis, Inuit, non-Indigenous counsellors and does not discriminate from who wants services. Can the Minister tell me if they are looking at this type of a model? If not, can they look into expanding or funding to expand this Arctic Indigenous Wellness Foundation, if they would like to, in other regions or to have them have funding to be able to go out and talk to other regions to work on a model like this?

Mr. Speaker, we are working with the Arctic Indigenous Wellness Foundation. Some of their programming that they provide is very unique.

Mr. Speaker, we also have staff who work to meet people where they are and help them to determine what is the best option for them. For some, it could be a form of counsellor, it could be also meeting with an Elder, so we do have options, Mr. Speaker, when it comes to the clients and what’s the best avenue for them to receive any of their counselling services.

I'm sure I will have many more conversations on getting that information for the adult wait times and removing some of the barriers for children getting into those diagnostics. I recognize there needs to be a stigma broken down that allows both mothers and people with FASD to self-disclose, but I was hoping the Minister of Health and Social Services could speak to the current barriers, to make sure we can improve access and get those wait times down, and get more people into the diagnostic clinic. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

2020-05-13 10:16:01,529 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. DIANE THOM: The Member is correct. There is a stigma surrounding FASD, and it is a barrier for individuals and families accessing diagnostic services. The Member asked: what are the barriers? The Northwest Territories' geographic remoteness creates challenges in ensuring equitable access to diagnosis. Medical travel is also a barrier for accessing diagnostic services, and can be particularly challenging for families with children with complex needs. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

My questions are for the very agreeable Minister of Industry, Tourism and Investment, who sets regulations for onshore oil and gas resources and also promotes such development. The Oil and Gas Spills and Debris Liability Regulations set absolute liability limits of between $10 and $40 million, depending on the location of the spill or debris caused by oil and gas exploration and development. Can the Minister explain why there are these liability caps in place and what public purpose they serve? Mahsi, Mr. Speaker.

2020-05-13 10:16:01,534 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. KATRINA NOKLEBY: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. As the Member mentioned, there is only a cap on liability when the person or entity who holds the authorization is not proven to be at fault for the spill or discharge, or other similar event. The cap balances the right to swift compensation against the lack of proof of responsibility, and ensures that funds can be accessed promptly, without having to prove fault or negligence on the part of the operator. If an operator or any person is proven to be at fault for a spill, there is no legislated limit on its financial liability and no cap on what they would need to pay to rectify the situation and compensate those affected, to the extent of the fault or negligence proved against them. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

Basically, they shield private companies from liability and, in this day and age, we need to be adopting a "polluter pays" approach. I'd like to know if the Minister can explain whether Cabinet intends to respond to the recommendations from the Standing Committee on Economic Development and Environment from the last Assembly. That committee recommended "a comprehensive review of oil and gas related regulation with the expressed purpose to increase the cap for absolute liability." Can the Minister explain: is she or the Cabinet actually going to respond to that recommendation?

Trades Apprenticeships

2020-05-13 10:16:02,900 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. ROCKY SIMPSON: Thank you, Madam Speaker. My questions will be for the Minister of Education, Culture and Employment. Small businesses are a cornerstone in the development of apprentices. Small businesses are willing to hire and support apprentices but rely on the subsidy program to offset associated costs. I would ask the Minister of Education, Culture and Employment: what is the total budget amount of financial resources directed toward wage subsidies for apprenticeships? Thank you, Madam Speaker.

The total amount budgeted in the previous main estimates was $1.072 million, and that's for the Trades and Occupations Wage Subsidy Program. Thank you, Madam Speaker.

2020-05-13 10:16:02,913 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. R.J. SIMPSON: We don't have the actuals for this fiscal year yet, as we are still in it, but in 2017-2018, there was $948,000 spent, so nearly the entire budget. In 2018-2019, it was down to $655,000, so there was a carry-over of over $400,000, and that is due to a decrease in the number of apprentices, the new registers, from 92 in 2017-2018 to 70 in 2018-2019.

2020-05-13 10:16:02,915 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. R.J. SIMPSON: The subsidy rate is $8 per hour, to an annual maximum of 1,600 hours per apprentice, and the maximum wage subsidy support is $25,600, because it's over two years; so it's for two years, $8 an hour, 1,600 hours a year.

2020-05-13 10:16:02,916 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. ROCKY SIMPSON: Thank you, Madam Speaker. For the final question, well, first of all, it's good to hear that, in a sense, there is extra money in the budget, money that may have not been spent. Is the Minister willing to look at extending the term for third- and fourth-year apprenticeships, as well, to add another year on? I would like to see the money be spread out a bit, and it will really help small business, as well. Will you consider subsidizing third and fourth years, as well? Thank you.

2020-05-13 10:16:02,917 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. R.J. SIMPSON: I appreciate where the Member is coming from. I know it's difficult for small businesses across the territory right now, and apprentices and journeypersons are in high demand. It's difficult to compete with the wages that are being offered by the mines and by government and by big industry, so to have that wage subsidy, it helps. If you're a small business and you're going into your third year with an apprentice, you might be concerned that you might lose that apprentice, and we need to help support them, so I am definitely going to look into this. We're going back to industry and to small businesses to see how these recent changes to the program have rolled out on the ground, and we'll make the decision from there, but I'm definitely going to consider all options, including extending this if those funds are available. Thank you, Madam Speaker.

2020-05-13 10:16:02,931 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. PAULIE CHINNA: Thank you, Madam Speaker. Looking at the policy that we currently have for the Northwest Territories Housing Corporation, I see that it was more meant for consistent income. It does not meet the needs of seasonal workers, and I see that. So then, looking at this policy, I want to review it. I want to see where we are at. I think that the decision made at that time was a perfect decision for that government, and it did reflect a lot of good intent. However, now, times have changed, and it does not meet the needs of the seasonal workers, so, yes, I am wanting to go back and take a look at that. I will follow up with the Member with the discussion and outcome.

Can this Minister give me a timeline on you getting rid of the T4 system and just people being able to go in every month, they show their pay stub, and then get their rent assessed on a timeline?

2020-05-13 10:16:02,949 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. PAULIE CHINNA: I don't want to commit to timeline, because there are going to be a lot of reviews that are going to have to take place in order to look at this policy. However, I also want to be mindful that I feel that the intent for the policy was to accommodate the consistent income earners, but, looking at the T4 slips, it's not working for the seasonal workers. I see that, but also that the rent scale also accommodates -- I don't want to say "accommodates," but also works with the Northwest Territories, that we are the lowest at the rent scale for the rest of Canada. The rest of Canada is at 30 percent. We are at 19 percent. I just want to be very mindful of that, but then I see where the rent scale is very confusing to understand and very confusing to administer, but I am looking at the best results for the residents of the Northwest Territories.

Looking at the T4 slips, I am not going to commit that this would happen anytime soon. I have to take a look at it first, before we end up making the changes, because our administration has to follow through with that. Thank you, Madam Speaker.

It is my understanding anti-SLAPP legislation is outside the scope of the work performed for the Environmental Rights Act and most likely would not be the responsibility of Environment and Natural Resources. However, in getting a heads-up with this question and understanding and looking at that one part of the report, I have reached out to my honourable colleague, the Minister of Justice, and we are more than willing to have conversations and with the Member, as well.

I am happy to be part of that conversation. My next question: I have reviewed the ENR website and could barely find any mention of a public registry for the Protected Areas Act, let alone some of the other legislation that the department is responsible for, including the Environmental Rights Act. Can the Minister tell us when or whether his department is considering a central environmental public registry to capture all of the reporting requirements found in the various environment and resource management bills, allowing the public a one-window access point to information, as is done in Ontario, for example?

2020-05-13 10:16:02,967 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. SHANE THOMPSON: The Environmental Rights Act and the Protected Areas Act are bills that were passed in the last Legislative Assembly, including registries. To implementation, ENR would start by meeting the information required in each of the acts. When implementation occurs, we will be looking for opportunities to centralize information as resources allow while not duplicating the comprehensive land and water board registries.

Look, I am trying to find ways to save this government money, and having a central registry is one way to begin to do that. There is similar reporting that is required from ENR around the Cumulative Impact Monitoring Program. That is under the Mackenzie Valley Resource Management Act. There is state of the environment reporting under the Environmental Rights Act. Can the Minister tell us how all of this environmental reporting is going to be coordinated?

2020-05-13 10:16:02,969 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. SHANE THOMPSON: The purpose and process and timelines for the environmental audit and the state of the environment reports are different. A state of the environment report is required to be tabled within three years of the revised Environmental Rights Act coming into effect and every four years afterwards. An environmental audit is conducted every five years by an independent body, and the next audit is due to be completed in 2025. The department continues to ensure that it meets reporting requirements in our environmental legislation and that this report is coordinated where appropriate.

There is nothing, though, on the ENR website about the Environmental Rights Act. There is a general page that talks about how the bill or the legislation was going to be reviewed in the last Assembly, but there is nothing there to help promote the understanding of the new legislation. Can the Minister tell us when his department will finally take a more proactive role in promoting this legislation, and will a plan be shared with the relevant standing committee?

2020-05-13 10:16:03,002 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — When the Regular Members request for information from ministerial offices, the general rule of thumb is that the turnaround time should be within five days or less. We understand that, sometimes, five days needs to be extended and, as long as the Minister's office lets Regular Members know about the necessary extension, we are generally fine with that. It has been well over two weeks since my request, so I'm just wondering if the Minister is familiar with the general rule of thumb, the five-day rule, within the process convention. It is very important to have this timeline turnaround.

Communication definitely needs to be improved in this area. Will this Minister responsible for the NWT Housing Corporation and her department commit to making improvements with respect to giving proper notice and on responding to queries from Regular Members?

They are working hard to be developing a representative workforce. That doesn't mean that that work happens over a day, and it doesn't mean that we have a representative workforce right now. Not to take away for a moment from the hard work that happens within that department. I do have every confidence that they are working toward that goal. That goal, however, as was already noted, has been noted more than once in this House, is more than simply that of one department; it is a goal for the entirety of the government. It's a goal that we are all going to be working toward. It's one that involves everything from early childhood indicators, to education, to better health outcomes, so that people are ready to work and able to work, so that they can benefit from the variety of programs that we have in the GNWT's HR.

2020-05-13 10:16:03,033 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. CAROLINE WAWZONEK: The Affirmative Action Policy is one that has different classifications depending on the types of jobs to which someone is applying. A P1 individual, for example, is someone who is Indigenous Aboriginal to the territory or someone who is Aboriginal and spent more than half their life in the Northwest Territories. There are also the P2 classifications. Depending, for a management position, there are 1A and 1B classifications. They are quite rigorous. They are clearly stated and, indeed, if someone meets one of those classifications and passes the requirements for a position, they are hired even over a candidate who may not be so classified but who may actually have scored technically higher in their application process. I have inquired and ensured that that continues to be applied, and I am happy to receive any information from any member of the public who may be concerned, and we have followed up with every one of the requests that we've received in that regard.

We run investigations. You make enquiries. Individuals who don't receive positions have appeal rights in some cases. I would encourage those who have access to such appeal rights to exercise them. Appeals are done by independent individuals, not Members of the GNWT. Indeed, very often workplace investigations, in many cases, can be done by individuals outside of the GNWT. There are a lot of different layers where independents come into play, external to the GNWT. In addition to that, Madam Speaker, again, there are obligations on all staffing to ensure that they are applying policies that are appropriate and following those policies that we have rigorously.

2020-05-13 10:16:03,065 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. R.J. SIMPSON: Thank you, Madam Speaker. Currently, we have official language guidelines, and these guidelines lay out the signage rules for government buildings. In addition to English and French, exterior building signs are to be translated into the local official languages. For the main directory board signs, the ones you see inside, the official Indigenous language appropriate to the local area should appear before English and French. Currently, the department under the Indigenous languages action plan, there's so many different names here, I can't keep them straight, but the Indigenous languages revitalization action plan, essentially, there's a lot that's going to be happening within the next two years. I just looked at the guidelines, actually, and the copy I found was from before division, and it's my understanding that that is the most recent copy. Some of the work we're going to be doing in the next two years is updating those, as well as updating the regulations. Infrastructure is doing work to update their guidelines around signage on buildings. The standing committee, with the assistance of the department, is going to be looking at the Official Languages Act. In the next couple of years, there's going to be a lot happening in terms of updating the way we display Indigenous languages in the territory. Thank you, Madam Speaker.

I completely understand that the act stipulates that there is a requirement that there is indirect supervision from a dentist. However, that means that a dental hygienist who wants to practise in northern communities needs to find a dentist who is willing to take them on under their wing, so to say, and that prevents people from being able to just go to communities on their own as a business owner and provide dental hygiene appointments or preventative healthcare to people who live in these small communities. What that will end up doing is driving up costs of dental care to people who live in Tuktoyaktuk or who live in Deline.

There was a question in the House by Inuvik Twin Lakes asking me last month: will the department look at establishing a territorial chief electoral health officer role? That is something our department is looking into. We need a position in place to be able to go. We look at some of our health centers, and the hygienist chairs are empty. I recognize that. Our department needs to go in and have a look at the system and see what is required within the legislation or perhaps make changes to it. Thank you, Madam Speaker.

JOHNSON: It appears, despite multiple meetings and no shortage of questions here, there still appears to be some breakdown in communication. Will the Minister responsible for the Housing Corporation ask CMHC and the women's society to get a hold of that application and the response and make sure that they are aware of all of the shortfalls that were in the application so that we are all on the same page?

They did have a conversation, and they did encourage Yellowknife Women's Society to submit the application. CMHC will be going through the application with them thoroughly so they would be able to address the concerns that CMHC had identified on the letter that was sent to them February 18th. Unfortunately, the Housing Corporation, we don't have the funding. We are not the main funding source, so we don't see the application at this point. Going forward, that relationship and that communication will start to improve.

JOHNSON: I am a little perplexed that, at this point with such a close deadline, the Housing Corporation has not seen the application and isn't aware of the shortfalls. I heard the Minister responsible for the Housing Corporation previously discuss not wanting to set proponents up to fail, wanting to make sure, if we are going to provide our funding for any housing project, that we know that it is sustainable. I do not understand how the Housing Corporation is capable of doing that without looking at the response from CMHC and without knowing the shortfalls in the application. My question is: is the Housing Corporation, then, fully relying on the judgment of CMHC to commit their money? Have we done any review of the application?

The Housing Corporation did have a conversation with the Yellowknife Women's Society. We did come to a conclusion in that we are here to work with them going forward. I really don't know how much further to comment, but the application does sit as a federal application. The decision is based on what the Yellowknife Women's Society is asking. The project, I believe, is $4 million.

They have reached out to almost everyone in this House. There has been nothing but attempts to reach out to the Housing Corporation and work with them. My concern is: on one hand, the Housing Corporation Minister is talking about not wanting to set people up for failure, wanting to make sure we have a strong investment, which I support. Yet, on the other hand, they are saying they are not even part of the application process. There is a deadline on here. I do not want the Housing Corporation, once the CMHC has provided their funding, to all of a sudden raise some new concerns that should have been raised months ago. My question for the Minister responsible for the Housing Corporation is: can we set out a guideline of what our role is in making sure we can successfully get the co-housing federal money from the federal government? Thank you, Madam Speaker.

It is federal money, territorial money, and looking at co-investment, co-investors, and to work with this project going forward. Right now, the Housing Corporation is engaged, and we are working on a process going forward and looking at how are we going to deal with projects like this and making sure that they are set up for success. Right now, I do have a meeting that's scheduled with CMHC to clarify a lot of the justification that they identified on the application, but going forward, I understand, and I hear the Member that the communication needs to be clarified.

I really want to stress that the Housing Corporation is not holding up that deadline, that there are requirements that are needed on that application. It needs to be completed, and I would really advise that, whatever the CMHC has included in their details in their letter and their conversation, that it needs to be met. The requirements need to be met. As the Housing Corporation, we are there to support the application. I hear the frustration, but, as the Housing Corporation, we are trying to work and figure out a strategy of how we are going to be working with the co-investment fund going forward.

Can we try to work with the Minister to get a timeline and using her Minister's directive in telling her staff before April 3rd, before this House is convened, that we have something in place where the LHOs could just start utilizing the income verification by cheque stubs in the communities instead of a T4 system or make it optional?

I am not familiar with policy changes and how fast we could make this happen. The policy that is in place currently, right now, I feel that it has been accommodating consistent income. Right now, we have changed, and we are recognizing that we do have seasonal workers. Going forward, I need to be very strategic and very specific on making these changes, so, unfortunately, I cannot commit to the April 1st date. I need to make sure that how the assessment was completed at first, that included the changes to the policy that we currently work with right now, what were the changes, what did they engage, what did they consider.

2020-05-13 10:16:03,163 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — Looking even at the cost of living and what does it honestly take for our units to be maintained and for them to be administered, I want to take those into consideration, as well, because, as the Northwest Territories Housing Corporation, we do spend $30,000 annually on the units; we do take care of the sewer, the fuel, the property taxes, the lease payments. I just need to make sure that, when we are calculating these rental incomes, it does accommodate the seasonal workers, just as we have made the adjustments to accommodate the consistent income earners. 
2020-05-13 10:16:03,164 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. JACOBSON: In regard to that, policies can be changed anytime. Once the Minister has directed and once the Minister makes that decision to go forward with it, she can make change. Change will happen when she tells her staff to make it happen. In regard to it, I appreciate all the work and what she is saying to us and stuff like that, but again, we have to realize that, the housing units, we get $45,000 a year, per person per year. That is every man, woman, and child, babies, everybody. The thing is, the housing, they are substandard housing in my riding, anyway. They are 30-plus years old. We have some new ones but not enough. We are short about 300 houses in my riding.

Would the Minister commit to me about making change and using no more T4s or make it optional? Even making it optional, you are still doing the same thing, the department, but you are making it optional for the person to come in every month to show you that slip, and you will get the exact amount, what you are doing, instead of ripping them off. 
2020-05-13 10:16:03,166 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. PAULIE CHINNA: I would encourage the clients in the riding of the Member to get into the LHO offices right now, do a rent assessment. Looking at the T4s, if they feel that they are paying a lot more and too much for the current public housing units that they reside in, that is an option. We do use the T4 slips annually to calculate their rent, to be consistent, but also there is the option to do the rent assessment. That can be done month by month, and it does not have to be based on the T4 for the rest of the year. We do recognize that we do have income earners who are not consistent throughout the year. I would really encourage the Member to speak with his constituents to get into the LHO offices in his riding and have a rent assessment completed.

They have a lot of problems. I want to talk about the treatment. [End of translation] It's been brought to my attention on the territorial treatment centre here in Yellowknife. We have a treatment for clientele ages eight to 12, for those who have emotional, behaviour, or psychiatric difficulties. Madam Speaker, it has been brought to my attention that, at the facility, the centre does not currently have a full-time psychologist on site at the treatment centre, and it has been almost five years or just over five years since they had one full-time at the site. When there was one full-time at site, it was well utilized by these high-risk clientele, these students or these children. Are there plans in place to have a full-time psychologist at site in the near future, similar to what they have had in the past? Masi, Madam Speaker.

2020-05-13 10:16:04,759 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. CAROLINE WAWZONEK: A number of initiatives have been begun in the last few months as a response to the fact that there were some challenges with this building when it initially came online. It's always expected that there is going to be some difficulty with a building that is the size and complexity of Stanton Territorial Hospital. Indeed, this hospital is arguably one of if not the most complex building ever undertaken by the Northwest Territories government, certainly one of the most technical in terms of the kinds of equipment, so while we are cognizant that there have been challenges, there is work under way. There are committees that have been formed now between BHP and the GNWT, to ensure that partners are adequately addressing issues in a prompt manner. There is currently a senior executive committee that meets now to oversee the fixing of any difficulties or problems that arise. Assistance is being delivered by the Department of Infrastructure to the partners over at the hospital so that, again, there are adequate hands on deck, essentially, to make sure that things are being looked at. As for the payment, there is a very detailed schedule in the contract where, if there are issues that should have been delivered by the partner, then the partner has to pay for that. There is contract monitoring to ensure, indeed, that, if there are performance issues that fall within the contract, then the payments that are being made regularly to the provider of services deducts that from their monthly payment.

The new Stanton hospital tax bill for the amount of $4.5 million is the highest taxed building in the NWT. The mayor of Yellowknife made a statement that she did not have to raise taxes because of a new assessed property value of the new Stanton hospital. My question is: as all monies out of public funds belong to the people of the NWT, are you comfortable as the Minister of Finance with this statement?

We do not pay taxes. We pay a grant in lieu, and the grant in lieu supports the city when the Government of the Northwest Territories is using what would be municipal land that the municipality could otherwise garner tax-based revenue from. Instead, there is a grant in lieu that is paid for the use of that land and, obviously, for all of the various city-based services that the GNWT uses on the footprint of the hospital. I am confident that the grant-in-lieu policy has been applied appropriately and fairly for the City of Yellowknife, for Stanton, as it is to all of the tax-base communities across the Northwest Territories. Thank you, Madam Speaker.

That process was due out in January. I acknowledge that it's now not January. I am assured that that will be complete and that that will public this month. I will certainly ensure that I am doing my best to follow up on that date. At that point, how quickly private individuals or private companies are able to develop their progress per store will be in the hands of those individuals or companies. Thank you, Madam Speaker.

Also, each community has a role in supporting and promoting the best interests of the children, and the wellbeing of the families and the communities. Yes.

The child and family services, you look at the children who are in place, and we have 99 percent of Indigenous children in place in care. Right now, within the Child and Family Services Act, the Indigenous and government organizations can enact their own child and family service law for their citizens. Right now, we have only one Indigenous group in the Northwest Territories who has reached out to our department, and is interested, and looking at what does that mean for their Indigenous groups. They have the option to enter into a process that would have their laws prevail over territorial law and the federal law. It is in our best interests to work with the Indigenous groups in the Northwest Territories as the majority of the children in care are in our care, and we would like to build on that partnership with Indigenous groups. If they can come to the table and do a better job than we are, then let's absolutely entertain that. Thank you, Madam Speaker.

I do want to recognize that enabling seniors to age in place with dignity is one of our priorities. If you look at the mandate priorities, it is a partnership, not only with the Health and Social Services, but also the Department of Education, Culture and Employment and the department of housing. If you look at the three objectives, number one, we need to increase supports so that seniors can stay in their own homes and communities. That's number one. Number two is fun actions that can enhance inclusion, safety, and remove community barriers. The other one is to help protect seniors from abuse or neglect. These are some of the areas that we are looking at for our mandate, but in addition to that, I do want to talk a little bit about what the Member's asking for, what are we doing. We have a variety of activities that are in our regions, and I do want to speak about a couple of them. We have adult day programs, including the elders in motion exercises, meal program, meals on wheels, and other recreation and social activities. Thank you, Madam Speaker.

You look at some of the regions. For example, I'll use in the Beaufort-Delta. We have a very strong elder day program where the elders come from their homes into the elders' day program, and they have a variety of activities. There are supports in place. However, there are limitations. I understand the Member's concern about the lack of possibly transportation or whatever the case may be.

We have a 48-bed slated for Hay River, and I think there is one for Inuvik, as well. One of the issues that I find is that, when I was visiting the other day, I noticed the handy van was sitting there, covered in snow. I asked the person, "Do they use it?" They said, "Not really because to take people out, it was slippery, and it was hard to get them in the van." One thing I suggest is that with this new 48 facility is that if they could have a little something off to the side where they can have the van parked so the people can go right in from the building into the van where it's warm and take them out. Kind of like they have for the ambulances. I would just ask the Minister if she would consider that in the design of the new 48-bed facility for Hay River and for Inuvik?

I also do want to remind the Member that the 48-bed facility in Hay River and Inuvik is still through the design process, so there is an opportunity for our department to work with the Department of Infrastructure to have a look at the designs and to be able to see what works for the communities. I mean, we need to build these facilities so that they work for our elders and for our communities. If that's one way of getting the elders out into the community, then, of course, that's something we would look at.

We know that the cost of airfare into our isolated communities is quite high across the North and my region, about three communities I represent. If any work has to be done on a senior's home in an isolated community, those travel costs are often passed on to the senior on top of the actual cost of the work involved. Are there any Housing Corporation programs specific to having a certified oil burning mechanic to visit all our communities so that they can service the furnaces for our most vulnerable seniors?

2020-05-13 10:16:04,947 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. PAULIE CHINNA: The Northwest Territories Housing Corporation created the seniors aging-in-place program to help seniors improve the durability of their home and to make energy-efficient retrofits every year. It is an easy program to access and seniors can apply for this every year. There is also a co-payment portion for seniors who make only low to moderate income. Seniors can also access the SAFE program, the emergency repair program, to access up to $10,000 per year for urgent emergency repairs, such as furnace failure. Seniors can also have their furnace maintained under the preventative maintenance program, up to $3,000 per year. As for seniors' complexes, I just really would like to stress that we have completed seniors' complexes throughout the territory, and we are now just looking at one in the Sahtu that is just completed. We've constructed five of them.

I'll just move on to the next question, because these are tough questions that the department should be answering, especially for our elders in the communities. A couple of months ago, I had an 82-year-old senior constituent out of Behchoko who had furnace issues, and this was broadcast on the CBC, as well, when we were in the middle of a two-week-long cold spell. Apparently, her furnace had not been serviced for a few years. In the end, Polar Ice from Yellowknife stepped up to the plate and fixed her furnace for free. Masi to Polar Ice for doing such an awesome job for this elder. Would the Minister consider implementing a pilot project so that every senior in our communities can have their furnace serviced on an annual basis as a safety precaution, as well?

I'm not familiar with the contractors who go into the isolated communities, but also I just wanted to inform the Member that we do have the SAFE program that is accessible for the furnace and upkeep of them and to make sure that they are maintained, and it's up to $10,000. I would encourage the residents in his riding to contact the Housing Corporation further to complete the application.

The Minister is referring to an application-based process, and a lot of our elders obviously are struggling, sometimes because of individuals living in their household. It's based on household income, so most times, they don't qualify, unfortunately. When it comes to two weeks of cold spell, this is a very urgent matter that we need to deal with on an annual basis, to service their furnaces, especially the vulnerable elders. I've touched on Polar Ice as a contractor going to the community, on their own services. Could we have something similar to that as a pilot project in our communities, not just my Tlicho communities, but other isolated communities in the Northwest Territories? I believe this is, indeed, an asset that we should be utilizing, having those individuals qualified to service the furnaces. Madam Speaker, masi.

I would like to know if he could be a little bit more particular or give us some more specifics about what these issues are. Look, this proposed protected area has been in process for years. The feds, as I understand it, are ready to go. They have the surface of the area that is going to be protected as a national wildlife area. The feds are ready to invest. I understand the community has lined up some private donors to set up a trust to hire guardians and so on. What is the problem? The problem seems to be our government not transferring the subsurface, so can the Minister tell us, give us more specifics?

Grants in lieu, there is a very careful policy, a detailed policy, that the government uses to establish what is owed to municipalities under the grants in lieu. It is a process that uses independent assessors to identify the proper amounts. It's something that is paid to all communities. It's paid to all communities, and it's budgeted for, and so there really should not be long-term surprises in the course of grants in lieu. It's an important aspect of maintaining our partnerships and our funding to communities when we are using the resources of those communities and using up the land that would otherwise be available for them to have own-source revenues.

I believe a very detailed and lengthy public process was offered for a technical briefing to the committee. The public was invited. That was put onto Facebook; it was made very open and accessible to the members of all of the Northwest Territories to ask hours of questions to some of the lead individuals involved in terms of designing that contract, implementing the contract, and providing services at the hospital. I believe, in fact, that those several hours' worth of review and briefings are still available through a link through the Legislative Assembly website. Thank you, Madam Speaker.

Earlier today, I heard the Minister of Lands commit that the land within municipal boundaries, there is a working group in place; hopefully, within a year, we have a process document; and then after that, we may see the land transferred. Unfortunately, I have to ask questions of every Minister to ensure that this is happening, so my question is for the Minister of Municipal and Community Affairs: is the Minister willing to enter into an MOU with the Department of Lands, Executive and Indigenous Affairs, the City of Yellowknife, Yellowknives Dene First Nation, and the heart of that MOU is that the land within municipal boundaries will be transferred?

This situation with a land transfer happening within a municipal boundary is a quite complex situation in that there are a lot of parties at the table that we would have to work with, going forward, and consult with. Right now, the department is not in favour of entering into an MOU, to be honest. There is a lot of consideration to be thought through, looking at the land transfer and the affected parties and what is going to be coming along with that transfer, and looking at that transfer and what is going to be available to the City of Yellowknife, to the YKDFN, and the affected parties that are there. Looking for a thorough assessment, I'd have to be working closely with my colleague for the Department of Lands, the Minister of Lands, and working with the City of Yellowknife and YKDFN. Those relationships have already been established, so going forward, we are speaking about this process. I'd really like to stress that the transfer is quite complex. It's not something that can easily be completed. Thank you, Madam Speaker.

Looking at this process, we are working closely with the stakeholders and closely with my colleague, the Minister of Lands. I would just like to really stress that it is a very complicated situation, and it's not as easy as it could be done signing papers and the transfer is complete.

2020-05-13 10:16:05,084 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. CAROLINE WAWZONEK: Thank you, Madam Speaker. When an individual is arrested and charged, it is within the decision-making of the RCMP whether or not to release the name. I can't take a role in terms of making a choice or directing their operations, although I am confident that, when appropriate, when there are no other factors of safety or other ongoing investigations, they do generally release those names by way of a media release quite promptly. When an individual is detained by the RCMP in the course of a program or in the course of another investigation, if they are detained but released without charge, that individual is just that; they are not charged. There can be any number of reasons why somebody might be arrested or detained at the same time as others. If the RCMP determine that they do not have the legal authority to hold them or charge them, then nor would it be appropriate for them to be releasing their name. I expect that that may be a source of frustration when it is not known as to whether or not there is a certain number of people who have been arrested and why they are not all being named, but it's, in fact, of course, because not all of them have been charged under the investigation. Thank you, Madam Speaker.

You know, when there was a person of interest from the RCMP in Alberta just recently, they released the names of two individuals. This is, I would say, similar. I would ask the Minister of Justice if she is willing to sit down with the RCMP "G" Division commanding officer and seek out if there is any way that we can provide those names to the general public. My constituents, I want to protect them, and with those kinds of names, we should be releasing those to the community so they are aware of the drug traffickers coming in from the South, or even from the North, bringing illegal drugs to our communities.

I would also note for the Member that the Minister does have policing priorities that are put out every year, every spring, and indeed it's my intention this year to reach out, and have begun the process of reaching out, to communities to ensure that the policing priorities that I issue are reflective of the concerns of the communities. I will speak to the Member further to ensure that policing priorities take into consideration the concerns and the issues that are being raised from these communities.

LAFFERTY: A lot of our communities do not have a RCMP detachment, and even my region, there are two communities that do not have an RCMP detachment. I fear for the communities, so I am glad the Minister is willing to meet with the chief commanding officer. I am hoping it's sooner than later. Winter roads are open, and all-weather road construction through Whati is happening. As soon as the Minister meets with the chief commanding officer, I would ask the Minister if she could provide the latest update on their discussion on this particular very important matter in my region.

I also believe that the RCMP would be themselves happy to engage directly with some of the committees of this House and to have that relationship about their operations, which is not within my area of responsibility. As for community safety going forward, that is a concern to the Department of Justice. There are a lot of different tools that can be used to increase and enhance community safety and community participation in the justice system, and I will continue to work towards those goals over the course of the Assembly.

2020-05-13 10:16:06,579 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — This has been an issue for a while now. One of the issues I find with the school curriculum is there are a lot of things that we should be teaching, and there are only so many hours in the day. When you talk to schools, they want to teach what they need to in order to take students to the next level academically, but also teach the type of life skills that students need. It's a struggle to find that balance of what we can fit in and where we can fit it, because there are only so many hours in the day. We do work on that. As for the particular courses and the particular programs, I can get that information for the Member. Thank you.

It is a very real issue that students are facing. They become counsellors, peer counsellors, who are dealing with heavy, heavy issues. That weighs on someone. People internalize that, and that becomes an issue for them. I am committed to looking into this.

2020-05-13 10:16:06,581 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MS. SEMMLER: I believe that the rates of suicidal ideation, which are thoughts of suicide, in our youth are higher than we want to believe. We as parents are struggling alone, thinking that we are the only ones dealing with this issue, but more and more I am talking to more parents and more educators; we are having a crisis that is not being brought to the surface. I want to ask if there is a way that the Minister of education can work with the health department to really capture how many of our young people are struggling with suicidal ideation.

That is why, in partnership with Health and Social Services, we are rolling out child and youth counsellors across the territory, because we recognize that this isn't something we can ignore. Schools are places where you go to learn, but you can't learn if you are dealing with so many other very, very serious concerns that are consuming all your time and are very emotional. I will do that work with my colleague.

At this time, I am not going to say one way or the other. I do recognize, again, the importance around the larger discussion of keeping Northerners employed and making sure our money is used for Northerners. However, it is my understanding that there is a bit of a strategy within the department that they do want to encourage the movement or relocation of fishers from the South to the North. I commit to the Member that I will look into this and maybe provide a more fulsome response in writing.

CBC's revelations about sexual abuse in amateur sport was really a call to action for prevention measures given the large number of children affected.

2020-05-13 10:16:06,651 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. NORN: Mahsi cho, Mr. Speaker. I just wanted to speak a little bit about my Member's statement earlier about the NWT Housing Corporation allowing appropriate small businesses to operate within their units. It's great, you know, when we did our round table, I always mentioned that we need to humanize our policies right across the board. I couldn't figure out a word to describe it, but I think my colleague from Yellowknife North really, in his address, mentioned that a lot of our policies are rigid. There is too much rigidity there, so, I'm happy to see that we're moving forward and being more proactive in changing our policies. On that, I have a question for the Minister responsible for the Northwest Territories Housing Corporation, and that's: will the Minister be open to give the tenants affected by this amendment a six-month grace period on their rent scale?

This is a new approach that the Housing Corporation is looking at right now, looking at the small businesses to be operating out of public housing units. It does require a lot of information-seeking, and looking at the six-month grace period, I would really have to look at this case-by-case, because, if the client is going to be entering into a business program, they are going to end up having to access a number of our government grants. Right now, I'm not going to commit to the six-month grace period because we need to review this further.

I acknowledge that we are continuing to face challenges to have a workforce that is truly representative of the people of the Northwest Territories. That remains the goal of human resources. That remains my goal as Minister, and I believe it's reflected in the mandates that we were given here to increase employment opportunities across the Northwest Territories.

2020-05-13 10:16:06,752 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — I would note that the Affirmative Action Policy is only one tool that the human resources department uses. There are a number of programs that I have spoken about in the House previously that we are also rolling out. In addition, there are efforts under way right now to work with some of the Indigenous governments so that human resources can better support the growth and development of the human resources capacities and some of the Indigenous governments across the Northwest Territories. Work continues, and hopefully, by engaging the committee in that technical review, we can advance this forward over the next few years.

That is always our goal. To the extent that there are technical issues or concerns around that, I will ensure that that's an element or an aspect of the briefing that I propose to engage with the committee, so as to ensure that we are doing the best, both to serve the people of the Northwest Territories and having a representative workforce, and doing so within a way that is reflective of the constitutional landscape of the country.

In our mandate, we are committed to implementing the 2030 Energy Strategy, something that I am very excited about, Mr. Speaker. Object 5 of the 2030 Energy Strategy is to increase residential, commercial, and government buildings' energy efficiency, by 15 percent. My question is for the Minister of Infrastructure: will the implementation of the action plan for the 2030 Energy Strategy include developing a building standards act such that we can ensure that those buildings meet that 15-percent target?

Meeting this target does not require the development of a building act, so the target will be met through grants and rebates that we are provided under the 2030 Energy Strategy. These will include the support for larger-scale building energy efficiency using the greenhouse gas grant program for building with industry, with almost $8 million in grants available over the four years. We are going to support community-building energy efficiency through the greenhouse gas grant program for governments, with over $7 million in grants available. We're going to support residents, businesses, and communities through Arctic Energy Alliance, and we have more than doubled their budget over the past two years. The Government of the Northwest Territories, the Housing Corporation, we all support the achievement of this target by ensuring that all new government buildings exceed the national energy code for buildings. In addition, we have $3.8 million per year for energy retrofits in the existing government buildings. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

I am very happy to see our GNWT best building practices followed. They are great practices. The reality on the ground is, if you are in a community, you can build whatever you want because no one comes and inspects it and no one enforces any of the building codes. Given this reality on the ground, is the Minister of Infrastructure willing to work with the Department of Municipal and Community Affairs and begin the work to develop a building standards act?

One of the things we've been hearing a lot is, A, we have no money; and, B, we need to reduce the red tape. Should we go forward with the buildings act, we would then have another layer of regulation that we would need to adhere to, when we already would still be forced to adhere to Canada codes. As well, there is a cost that would come with developing this act that we potentially don't have the funds for. I do commit to the Member to start the discussion with the departments that he's mentioned and see where this can go, and I would also then include the architects' association, as well as the engineering and geoscience associations, and other interested stakeholders for their input on whether or not that an act would definitely be required. I do acknowledge, though, again, that there are issues with building inspection and whether or not things are being built to code.

It's a free-for-all right now, as soon as you leave Yellowknife, in regard to building standards. We have a number of codes and guidelines, some are enforceable, some are not, but at the end of the day, there is no one there to enforce this at a territorial level. Mr. Speaker, my question for the Minister of Infrastructure is: in implementing the energy strategy, and working with those departments, can we leave here at the end of four years enforcing those standards?

There is a Motor Vehicles Act that would be enforceable on our highways, so I'm assuming that would be one of the ways in which we do enforce the safety. Currently, as well, though, I did want to let the Member know that the Government of the Northwest Territories is working with our federal, provincial, and territorial colleagues to develop a common minimum training standard for commercial truck drivers across the country, so we are providing input and feedback to the federal government and our counterparts on where we see that there needs to be improvements. We've also been taking on a number of highway upgrades and will continue to do so. I know there's an area of concern on the highways with chipseal not being very good, or the quality of the roads not being very good, which also impacts driver safety. We're going to continue to apply for and receive federal funding to upgrade our roads. There's a lot of work being planned in the next four years on Highway No. 1 and Highway No. 3.

This is an application of communication, computer, and system technologies, to make the transportation in the territory safer. There will be many benefits for this. It should increase the traveller information that we're collecting as a department; it will give us real-time data; it should be helping us to become better informed to make decisions.

I'm not sure if they are specific to the trucking industry; that's the industry that I'm discussing today. I mentioned the dangers of flying mud, rocks, and snow coming out of the trucks when you pass them. I've driven on the highway for quite a number of years, since 2008, when I had to work out of Hay River, going back and forth to Fort Providence. I've experienced a lot of that. Now, my time coming up to Yellowknife for the sittings. There's lots of, you know, flying mud, rocks; the mud covers your windshield totally. The snow is very, very bad. It's scary to get out there. Can the department engage the trucking industry to come up with new technology for the tire mud flaps so nothing flies out to oncoming traffic, which is posing serious risk to the travelling public?

2020-05-13 10:16:06,867 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. KATRINA NOKLEBY: I'm not sure if my department would be engaged to provide feedback to the trucking industry. However, we could definitely look into some ways and see if there is an opportunity, or a forum that maybe we need to become a member of, in order to be providing that. I did want to say, with respect to the mud and the rocks, and such, we are trying to implement, as much as we can, chipseal programs on roads that are not currently paved. Chipseal is basically a type of asphalt or pavement. We are looking to reduce the number of gravel roads that we have; however, again, very expensive. We also have a lot of issues to do with melting permafrost that makes having paved roads a lot more difficult to maintain and keep in an adequate manner. I commit to the Member that perhaps we need to do some education, as well, ensuring that trucking companies are ensuring that their truckers do have the appropriate flaps, et cetera.

The mandatory commercial truck driver training that we're working on nationally is for the trucking industry. 
2020-05-13 10:16:06,869 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. BONNETROUGE: Like I mentioned in my Member's statement, we're seeing an increase in truck traffic. You know, when I was coming up here last weekend, on the Sunday, I met up with six trucks on the road, and they were following very close to each other. It's a good thing it wasn't snowing; I probably would have hit one of them. That's what's happening. It's just a big increase with truck traffic on the highways, and we're not really regulating them. We don't see highway patrols out there. They're just running down the highway, you know, wanting to splash mud all over you in the summers, and whatnot. It still happens with the chipseal stuff. I'm just wondering if the department can meet with the suppliers, businesses, and mining executives to determine their needs and stockpiles in trying to decrease the amount of truck traffic on our highways?

I take into note the Member's concerns, and yes, I will commit that as part of our development of our strategies going forward for highways. We will most assuredly, and I believe we already do, engage the trucking industry and get their feedback. As we've been speaking again, as a larger group, we do want to improve our systems and process as a government by ensuring we are listening to the people who are using our products and services. I commit to all of the Members right now that, every single thing I'm doing, I am collecting end-user feedback as best I can and will continue to do so.

To be honest to the Member, we have not seen a copy of the application, and I have requested that Arnica Inn provide that to us and have a conversation going forward. I know that it doesn't sound fair, but honestly, this is CMHC's program. The Northwest Territories Housing Corporation is not involved in the process, but we do support the applicant and assist them in completing the application.

Is there a way for the NWT Housing Corporation to receive the application as a copy, knowing that there is no adjudication by the Housing Corporation; it's up to CMHC, but can you at least receive the same information that they receive so that you understand what's being requested and how you can support it?

For some context here, I'm keeping in mind these parents struggling to support their families who are on Income Assistance to get their small businesses up and running. My question to the Minister is: will the Minister commit to having a six-month grace period for individuals with their small businesses to have their Income Assistance not be affected while their business gets up and running?

This is part of a broader discussion that we have been having about how we can better use Income Assistance to get people into the workforce or support self-sufficiency. The Member spoke earlier about a laissez-faire approach to business, and some of the concerns around this are, if Income Assistance is paying for rent as well as income while someone is starting a small business, that puts them at advantage over other people who have other expenses, to pay for office space, and things like that.

2020-05-13 10:16:06,922 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — That being said, the Member makes a very good point. You can't get back on your feet if, as soon as you're making a bit of money, you're knocked down. People who collect Income Assistance are not automatically disqualified once they start a small business. If they still meet the requirements, they are still eligible for Income Assistance. 
2020-05-13 10:16:06,923 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — That's a long way to say that this is a bigger question than just saying yes right now. The review that we're doing in terms of Income Assistance is a big review. It's looking at what we want this program to accomplish. I can't make this commitment, because it's going to cost money to do what the Member is asking. That has to go through the Financial Management Board, and it has to go through this Assembly. That being said, I am looking at ways to reform the system to make sure that we help people get ahead and don't contribute to keeping them down. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

The exact duties and job descriptions of the Victim Services coordinators, they are not very clear. These are delivered through third parties in various communities.

Now, with respect, Mr. Speaker, to the work being done by Victim Services providers in the communities, I have had the opportunity of working directly, prior to being in this role, with some of the individuals who provide Victim Services.

That said, with respect to generally their duties and the supports, I am assured that the current review that is underway will consider whether or not our Victim Services workers are being given adequate supports and what more might need to be done, if anything, to better support them.

I can assure her that is what I heard first-hand, directly from a constituent who had to serve in that capacity before. The community-based approach to Victim Services makes a lot of sense, of course. It has been in place since 1996, but clearly, the network of supports and coordinators has never been completed. As I understand it, there are 11 coordinators in eight communities. Can the Minister tell us if there are plans to expand these services to all of our communities, and when will that happen?

In the meantime, Victim Services workers do provide assistance by phone, though certainly I have no illusions; that is not the same as being in person. Again, Mr. Speaker, I will be waiting on that review to determine whether or not some further action needs to be taken to expand or how else we might better support victims of crime across the territories.

2020-05-13 10:16:08,589 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. CAROLINE WAWZONEK: I am alive to the fact that, in fact, there has been some increase to the budget of the Victim Services provision here in the Northwest Territories. In the most recently tabled main estimates, there has been an increase of $240,000 to Victim Services. That is the first increase to victim-services based funding in many, many years and will help better support the provision of those services. One other note is that we are also improving the supports that we give to our Victim Services workers, that there is a small pool of funding provided through federal funding. That helps provide enhanced health supports. Because these are partners in the communities, they are not necessarily given the opportunity or do not necessarily within their employment have enhanced or expanded health benefits. There is some funding available for these workers should they need additional, whether it is psychological supports, counselling, or otherwise. That is coordinated through the Department of Justice. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

One thing that I routinely have heard lately from my constituents is that the government seemed to very easily find the extra million dollars to cover the taxation error for the Stanton Territorial Hospital. It was a very expensive oversight that could have almost doubled the amount of funding that the mandate proposes to include to close the municipal funding gap over the next four years. I am wondering if the Minister will at least commit to including the rate of inflation in the $5-million mandate commitment for closing the funding gap? Thank you.

I have it here in front of me, and I am looking at it. I walked through with one of my constituents. It was a very difficult process. I think it would have been far easier to go take their claims and go to H&R Block and go fill it out, but I don't think we want to do that with our constituents to do these forms. I think we should make it more user-friendly and easier to go through and streamlined. My question to the Minister is: can the Minister commit to having this form reviewed and redesigned? Thank you.

Medical travel in the Northwest Territories, it is a big program. The medical travel office has not previously heard concerns about the expense claimed from clients, however, the form serves two purposes: number one, the medical travel office needs certain information about the expenses being claimed to ensure expenses align with travel to an approved appointment in order to authorize payment. That is number one. Number two is: the Department of Finance also needs that form as part of the backup payment under the government's accounting system. I am open to meeting with the Member to hear any suggestions he may have to simplify the form. However, the information on the form needs to be collected in enough detail to be financially accountable to standards and to satisfy also the requirements of the non-insured health benefits program, as well, as well as third parties. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

On January 27, 2020, the Northwest Territories Health and Social Services Authority had transitioned to the GNWT service accountability and management, which is called SAM. This brought six of our different financial systems carried over from the previous regional health authorities to align to a coordinated system. Prior to this change, payments were processed from within the health authority, and now, the GNWT's financial and employment shared systems, FESS, centres with the Department of Finance process payments. The centres provide Northwest Territories Health and Social Services Authorities with a convenient one-stop shop for processing all its financial transactions. This is the same system used by other departments within the GNWT. This change is meant to provide more consistency in the payment processing and better financial information across the Health and Social Services centre.

The form is usually provided prior to travel as it is required to be signed by the clinician as confirmation proof of attendance to their appointment. The form is available at any medical travel office or at all health centres throughout the Northwest Territories. However, based on the feedback, I will advise the Northwest Territories Health and Social Services Authority to post the medical travel expense claim to their website to ensure that there is one available online. In addition, if clients have difficulty completing their expense form, I would encourage them to reach out to the health centre or to the regional medical travel office for support. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

I appreciate the Member's acknowledgement about the difficulty of sometimes changing a process that has been going on a while. They have tried in the past to change some hours or to privatize the office here, and it didn't work well.

2020-05-13 10:16:08,705 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — Some of the issues in which they were saying was the problem was that the timing and having people working late was leading to situations of harassment and even stalking. If that was to occur, there needs to be a response team available to the office that is located there. That would then mean extending security hours and others. It would also mean to extend the hours of people who could do the special approvals or overrides and authorizations. It is not just those three people sitting at the front or one person sitting at the front; there is other staffing that would have to be amended. 
2020-05-13 10:16:08,706 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — There were things around even just the building maintenance that would then have to change in order to have the extension of the hours. A big one was also in dealing with the union collective agreement, which I am not the Minister for, so I won't speak to. However, there would need to be negotiations and changes to that contract in order to extend the hours. Currently, we only have two funded issuing positions and one supervisor position. Any of these issues would not allow a six-day-a-week issuing without hiring additional staff, and as we have all heard many, many times in the last little while, we have no money. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 
2020-05-13 10:16:08,707 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. JOHNSON: That was quite the list of challenges to simply being open for evenings and weekends. I do believe there is a solution here, and I do believe that I can work with the Minister to find one, even if we were to close Mondays and open Saturdays. That would be the exact same amount of working hours. Perhaps that is one of the solutions.

2020-05-13 10:16:08,708 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — I am going to spend the next four years trying to work through each of these issues. I would like to begin with the collective agreement. The Minister is correct that collective bargaining is the department of the board of management, of which she is a member, and it is chaired by the Minister of Finance. Ultimately, each department brings towards to form the GNWT's bargaining mandate, which then meets with the respective union. 
2020-05-13 10:16:08,719 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — My question for the Minister of Infrastructure: is she willing to write to the Minister of Finance that the Department of Infrastructure, in the future, would like the flexibility to extend those hours at the department of motor vehicles?

I am asking the Minister of Infrastructure to write on behalf of her department to the Minister of Finance asking for the opportunity for more flexible hours at the department of motor vehicles to be pursued during bargaining. 
2020-05-13 10:16:08,722 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. KATRINA NOKLEBY: The Member is correct in that there is a lot of conversation that will go on within the Cabinet and which I would very much be okay with having a discussion with my colleague about your email. I have to say I was actually quite intrigued when I received your questions and did look at this as maybe an opportunity of something we could change. However, as I learned the processes of the GNWT, I understand that there is a process that has to be followed. Yes, I want to streamline and change processes so that they are more efficient. However, at this point, with the knowledge I have, I do not want to say that I would put a formal writing request in to my colleague.

That is one part of it. Last month, the group renamed as the territorial committee on problematic substances. Its mandate is to develop a comprehensive response to the ongoing issues related to substance abuse in the Northwest Territories. 
2020-05-13 10:16:08,739 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — One of the deliverables for the Northwest Territories will be in the form of a whole-of-government alcohol strategy. It has already been identified in the CAPE, as it is an evidence-based review, as having a specific territorial strategy to discuss alcohol-related harms in a coordinated approach that will have a measurable impact. 
2020-05-13 10:16:08,740 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — The whole-of-government approach is 11 policy domains, as I mentioned, as part of the CAPE report, and many of them fall just outside of the Health and Social Services, hence the importance of having a territorial approach.

2020-05-13 10:16:08,774 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. KATRINA NOKLEBY: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I am not sure of any ranking structure within our capital plan, but I could definitely look to see if there is one. The department fully acknowledges that the Frank Channel Bridge does need to be replaced. In fact, we have been applying for funding, federal funding, to replace the bridge, and instead have actually been turned down the last times that we have tried. We have not been successful; however, we do feel that the next application has a good shot of being approved by the Canadian government, so that is our next step.

2020-05-13 10:16:08,785 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — We have had early engagement with industry about the planned rehabilitation, and industry representatives at the time told us that they did want the replacement of the bridge and the elimination of the overhead structure. That would allow for the strangely shaped and oversized loads to get on the bridge. We are currently engaging with the community of Behchoko and the Tlicho Government on the replacement of the bridge, the pre-engineering and environmental baseline work to prepare for its replacement. We will have a request for proposals out for the bridge design this year, and the department is continuing to do internal work to advance the project and secure the funding for the construction of the bridge. Thank you.
2020-05-13 10:16:08,787 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. LAFFERTY: I understand a proposal was submitted in the 18th Assembly to replace the Frank Channel Bridge, but unfortunately, it failed to secure funding. I understand there is a federal counterpart to this. Is there a new plan to seek federal assistance on the Frank Channel Bridge? What kind of schedule are we looking at?

My understanding is it will happen after the federal budget is passed in the House, so the intent is to move this project forward as quickly as possible. There have definitely been issues with the bridge, we do understand. However, I should point out that the bridge is safe. It is currently inspected by engineers. There was an interim measure to preserve the bridge until the project funding could be secured, and concrete deck repairs were carried out in September of 2018 and June of 2019.

I believe the Government of the Northwest Territories is doing a good job, and we are trying very much to get in front of the federal government to impress upon them our infrastructure deficit. When you asked me about ranking, I believe all of the deficits we have in our infrastructure are all critical pieces that need to be funded and we need to get them going, so there is a process. We plan to resubmit the plan as soon as we can. We have been applying actively for funding for this project. This is a critical piece of infrastructure that allows our mining industry to go forward, our resupply of goods and services and things to Yellowknife and to communities beyond, so this piece of infrastructure is very, very important and high on the department's radar.

Our MP also asked me where the proposal was and has it been submitted. At that point in time, that was a few months ago, I said, "I imagine it has been, with a new government." Unfortunately, it is not there at this point. I am afraid we are going to miss the opportunity again, because we still had the funding criteria last time. This is through the National Trade Corridors Fund, I believe, and I would highly encourage the Minister to get hold of our MP and also their federal counterpart. When could that happen? I would assume, I hope, it will be immediately after we have our session here, Mr. Speaker. Masi.

Therefore, we were waiting for that to happen as well as their budgets to go through, and then we would be making the application again. As stated, we have consistently been trying to get this funding, so this is not falling off my department's radar. In fact, it is one of the things that we are moving forward on. I have met with MP McLeod, and we have started to have discussions about the infrastructure deficit that the Northwest Territories is facing. I sat down and had a specific meeting with the MP on this issue; not at the moment, however. That has been more of a schedule issue, and we have been talking about getting our offices together to have the more infrastructure-focused conversation rather than the larger conversation we have been having with the MP as a Cabinet. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

In the community, I am hearing from young kids, under 19, who are starting into these hard drugs, crack cocaine and things like this. We need to be doing this education before.

I have spoken several times in this House about the harm that alcohol does to the people of the Northwest Territories. We spend a fortune on the effects of alcohol abuse without ever addressing the elephant in the room, which is alcohol itself. Alcohol touches every part of our lives, whether we drink or not. With this in mind, I was delighted to discover that the Department of Health and Social Services has started preliminary work on an alcohol strategy. My question for the Minister is: what does she want an alcohol strategy to accomplish? Thank you.

That is one of the things we would like to have a look at. Also, the territorial government had a territorial committee on problematic substance abuse, and this was just established in January. The mandate is to develop a comprehensive response to the ongoing issues related to substance in the Northwest Territories. That's why the department is looking at an alcohol strategy.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

As I mentioned, there are 97 on the wait list. The majority of these are single and they've been waiting six, seven years on this wait list, living with other families, couch surfing. I have one member who just told me she lives in a three-bedroom house with eight people, and she has health issues. So what is the plan for the housing Minister to deal with the authorities to get these people housed?

2020-05-13 10:16:10,523 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. JOHNSON: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Yesterday, during question period, the Minister responsible for the NWT Housing Corporation repeatedly said that the Women's Society should reach out to her regarding the Arnica project. I can confirm that they've been in contact with the department throughout this process. Mr. Speaker, there's a $60-million co-investment fund for housing allocated to the Northwest Territories. My concern is: I am sick of being reactive. We need to be a proactive government that goes out and gets that money. Will the Minister commit to setting up a meeting with all the relevant parties to the Arnica project and get to the bottom of what the issue is, and see whether we can save this project?

The problem here is that this is the first one that seemed to fail, and I don't want to be standing up in the House every single time we hear that our Housing Corporation did not support a project. My question is: will the Minister assign someone in the Housing Corporation to coordinate applications and work with proponents so that we can access this federal money?

The Arnica application was the first; not the Arnica, the application from the Yellowknife Women's Society was one of the first applications that made it to the second stage. Actually, it is the first. Going forward, we will be looking at a position that will fill the responsibility to make sure that there is straight communication for the application process from the Housing Corporation.

Throughout this process, it is clear there has been a breakdown in communication in exactly what the Housing Corporation's role is and whether they are providing technical advice, whether they want partnerships with Indigenous governments for all projects, whether they are going to fund the 25 percent. Will the Minister commit to setting out clear guidelines for the application process and what the Housing Corporation's role is in accessing this federal co-investment fund?

KATRINA NOKLEBY: MTS has contracted ORSI due to their unique expertise in the recruitment and day-to-day management of offshore labour, so we do not have a current plan for the government to assume this function. We do have the marine training centre in Hay River, which is funded by Transport Canada, and that was providing marine-related industry training to Northwest Territories residents. We wanted to introduce them to the marine industry in hopes that they will pursue careers in the field and we can increase our numbers there. We did employ a number of the students last year from that institute, as did the Canadian Coast Guard. Where we can, MTS will continue to commit to employing those students in the future. We employed a total of 194 employees in 2019 to support the operations in the peak season, 92 of whom were Northwest Territories residents and 39 were local-hire Indigenous residents. Thank you.

I guess I have lived in Hay River for close to a hundred years, and I have worked for NTCL before, and, when I was a kid, I used to hang around there. It always seemed at that point that there was pretty well all, even riverboat captains and that, it was Northerners who worked there. There were very few Southerners. All of a sudden, as time goes on, we shift. We make that shift, and we always think everything is better in the South. I guess I am just making a point there. The question is: what oversight is in place to ensure this government is receiving cost-effective service from ORSI?

The contract for the services includes terms and conditions which the contractor must abide by. GNWT MTS management staff are responsible for ensuring the contractor performs, and they are in regular, frequent contact with the contractor management. Costs are managed on a biweekly basis by the MTS finance staff, and they are ensuring the invoice costs are in line with those terms and conditions of the contract. Like I said, the current contract does expire in 2020, at the end of this year, so we will be reviewing the performance of the contractor prior to extending for the last option that we have, so I commit to working with the Member going forward to hear his concerns about that and addressing them.

In the very first round of legislation post-devolution in the last Assembly, what we did was we passed a Public Land Act that removed mandatory financial security. How could that happen? First time we get a chance to try to deal with something like this and we remove the mandatory financial security. Unbelievable, Mr. Speaker. That act is not in force yet, thank goodness, but I want to see if the Minister is willing to re-evaluate what happened with the Public Land Act and put in place mandatory financial security again.

He informed me that we spend approximately $6.5 million a year simply administering income security. I believe much of this time is chasing people and making sure those on Income Assistance meet their monthly reporting requirements. Mr. Speaker, will the Minister commit to asking his department to review the monthly reporting requirements and, where it makes sense, to extend those to longer time periods so people are not living 30 days at a time?

2020-05-13 10:16:10,736 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — As the Member pointed out, there are people whose incomes don't vary. They are steady. They don't go up or down, and if they do, it might be by just a few dollars every month, and they might stay that way for years. The Member is correct; there is no reason to have those people reporting on a monthly basis. While there is an opportunity right now for some of those clients to be what is called "payrolled," meaning that they only need to report maybe every three or six or 12 months, that is something we are looking to develop into an actual program. We have perhaps a separate program for persons with disabilities and people who have aged out of the workforce, whose incomes won't be going up and going down. That would make the lives of those people easier, and it would also free up our client services officers to help other clients who they are dealing with.
2020-05-13 10:16:10,737 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. JOHNSON: I am very glad to hear that answer and I look forward to the Minister reporting back whether we actually increase the number of people who are payrolled. My second concern here is that I have spoken to a number of private landlords and they have informed me that, if people are payrolled, and if they can guarantee rent for more than 30 days, they would buy a building and fill it with Income Assistance clients. Presently, the way it goes is, if it a person misses their reporting appointment and doesn't get the money for the next month, then they can't pay their rent, and then that landlord runs into the Residential Tenancies Act and has to go through a lengthy process to evict the person who can't pay their rent. My question is: will the Minister, during this review which he's asked his department to conduct of putting more people on payroll, look into the issue of working with private landlords to guarantee them rent from tenants?

I understand what the Member is saying; I've had a number of constituents over the past four years who have run into these types of issues, so it's something I'm alive to. I look forward to having conversations with my colleague, the Minister of Justice, as well as the Minister of housing, so we can create a system that works for everybody.

JOHNSON: I appreciate that this work is being done, but I think the ultimate goal here should be not just payrolling people but providing a guaranteed liveable income. That is an amount that no person can fall below so that no one in the Northwest Territories is living in poverty. While the Minister is asking his department to conduct this review, can we look at the benefits that a guaranteed liveable income would provide the North?

They need to be delivering services. It's the policy people. It's the people who would put their minds to these kinds of things. I can only do so much. Right now, the mandate has tasked ECE with some big jobs, the biggest reform to education that we have seen in a generation. There is quite a bit going on, so I cannot commit the staff to doing that at this point because there are other things that need to get done.

The project for Arnica Inn and the NWT Housing Corporation, I would like to elaborate on it a little bit, is that the Arnica Inn was advised to submit an application to CMHC.

2020-05-13 10:16:12,394 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MS. CLEVELAND: Just so that I am on the same page, then, the government did not not support the project of the women's society and have asked the women's society to resubmit their application?

With the missing criteria, that has to be completed first because it is a federal program; it is not a territorial program. I would strongly advise the women's society to go ahead and look at their application, revise it, because they do have a deadline, and to contact our office, reach out to us, should they need us to go ahead and assist them in completing the application, as we did provide assistance before. I would like to strongly advise that the women's society reach out to the Housing Corporation.

September, October, we've heard it. Members, these women here, have supported it going forward, so it's surprising that we are still talking about the process itself.

2020-05-13 10:16:12,427 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — Going forward with the Housing Corporation, we do have several initiatives to work with that. Going forward, looking at the 43 units that were available, I believe strongly that there should have been more involvement, there should have been more communication. With the final submission of the application, I actually met with the Yellowknife Women's Society in December, and I advised them that I would like to see Indigenous partnership with the project, and I would like to see how is the project going to be integrated. 
2020-05-13 10:16:12,439 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — In the Northwest Territories, we are a government that does acknowledge Indigenous people. I would have really liked to see the Indigenous component. We did have a strong conversation, and, once again, I advised the Yellowknife Women's Society to reach out to us. 
2020-05-13 10:16:12,440 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR.

2020-05-13 10:16:12,441 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — The Yellowknife Women's Society is a highly respected, extremely well-run non-profit agency that has been helping disadvantaged northern families for upwards of 30 years. It has extensive experience in transitional and emergency housing. If the Housing Corporation had problems or issues with the Arnica Inn project as the Minister alluded to earlier, why didn't it help the women's society to overcome those challenges as opposed to just plain ignoring those letters and emails that were going back and forth? 
2020-05-13 10:16:12,441 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. PAULIE CHINNA: I recognize that the women's society has well established themselves respectfully in the Northwest Territories. Going forward, the Housing Corporation does not have any issues with the project. Like I have said, we contributed into projects with them prior to Christmas, calculating at least approximately $2 million. We have looked at the housing and homelessness initiative in the Northwest Territories.

2020-05-13 10:16:12,442 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — Going forward, I have not seen the final application. I have not seen the business plan. It has not been shared with us, and I would strongly, once again, encourage the Yellowknife Women's Society to quickly reach out to us. They do have a deadline of March 31st or March 30th, I believe. Responding to the emails and the letters that were sent out, last week, we were travelling, and I wanted to solely concentrate on this issue. I wanted to look at it clearly and understand it. 
2020-05-13 10:16:12,443 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — As I said before, the project was not expressed in my campaign. It was not expressed in the Sahtu, but it is for the Yellowknife area. We do have seven MLAs within this riding. Looking at it going forward, I strongly encourage the Yellowknife Women's Society, because they have a deadline, to reach out and get their application resubmitted. 
2020-05-13 10:16:12,444 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. LAFFERTY: That is the fear that I have right now, where we are not being proactive as the GNWT, reaching out to those organizations and assisting them in submitting the proposal, so we don't raise that issue in the House here. It should have been dealt with a long time ago. I am more concerned about those 42 homeless people today who do not have a place to go to. We are sitting around the table here, talking about the process. This is what we need to do.

We don't see that application, so we don't know what the final ask was. When that application was put forward, I also did express to the Yellowknife Women's Society that they actually budget for renovation costs, should they come through, that they end up with a renovation that could cost millions of dollars, an environmental assessment that could cost millions of dollars.

In the letter sent from CMHC, they were concerned about the feasibility, and they did not elaborate on it. I really need to see that report because, if we open these 43 units and the building is not feasible, what are we going to do as a government with 43 people who would end up having to evacuate that building within six months? Are we in a financial state to house 43 people who would end up on the street? The same scenario happened in Hay River with the high-rise burned, and none of the people who were in the high-rise were housing clients, but we did make an effort to get modular homes into that community. 
2020-05-13 10:16:12,458 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — That is my concern, but right now the urgency is to get that application submitted and get it in, put it in, because, if there is missing information, I would really honestly like them to include the renovation costs, should that end up becoming a problem in the future.

We've heard rumours -- not rumours, but we've heard from traditional hunters that wolves may not be as abundant as they are right now, so that may have an impact on it. We're hoping that the traditional hunting and harvesting will be done, and we will never have to use the aerial; but, if it needs to be done, that will be the department making that final decision.

ENR is supporting Indigenous governments to document these key habitats and features. We will then work collaboratively to identify legislative tools to establish conservation areas. The Bathurst Caribou Range Plan recommends managing the total level of development on the range of the herd, including industrial development in communities and roads.

In my mind, the premise of a co-investment fund is that applications are jointly reviewed and decisions are made, so I don't understand or appreciate the siloed approach between what goes to the CMHC and what goes to the Housing Corporation if both are requested to be investors in this project. What can you do to try and work more effectively with the CMHC so that you have the same information at the same time that they have the information?

The longer they take to submit those documents and those papers, they are going to lose out on their own initiative. They should at least be able to resubmit that application so CMHC can have another look at the application and reconsider their decision. Also, the concern on the application was to look at the long-term viability of the units and also the affordable criteria. I would really like to look at that application that they submitted.

What I am saying is there is no one model that fits all. All the research that I have been doing says you need to fit the governance structure within the operations of the organization.

It's my understanding that the Tlicho Government was involved with the negotiation of the numbers and the quota for the Tlicho All-Season Road, so I cannot speak specifically to why those numbers were not as the Member would like to see. However, I believe, as the Cabinet and all of us together, all 19 of us together, have made retaining our government dollars in the North and maximizing them for the benefits of all residents of the Northwest Territories a priority that we are committed to, one that I am personally committed to, I think that the Member will see that, under a different direction of this Cabinet, we will be seeing more of those contract dollars staying in the North and looking at more of the indirect benefits of retaining northern businesses and Indigenous businesses. I cannot speak to why this one ended up the way it did. I was not part of that negotiation. However, I would be more than willing to discuss that with the Member going forward on future contracts, if he would like.

That being said, it's difficult to always estimate exactly how much we'll need, so there have been overruns of about $2 or $3 million every year, so say maybe $35 million would be spent in 2018-2019. Of that, about $6.5 million is for Income Security Program support. The other $27 or $28 million or so goes directly to clients. I'd also like to mention that we also have additional income security programs, such as the Senior Home Heating Subsidy, that also provides some income security. Thank you.

Before any proposed legislation comes forward, obviously, there needs to be a legislative proposal put together, and in the course of preparing a legislative proposal, there is a process convention that requires that an appropriate standing committee will see a copy of that legislative proposal. That's the early stages of all development of legislation. It will certainly not be our intention to deviate from that. It would be our intention to follow that process convention so that, when we are going through those early stages, the relevant standing committee would be involved. In that sense, the consultation of this House will take place.

2020-05-13 10:16:12,787 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — Meanwhile, Mr. Speaker, as I believe I mentioned previously, the idea of modernizing the Public Service Act started two years ago. There was detailed research done. At that time, both unions were consulted at length, and they continue to be consulted now in terms of understanding where this idea might go. As far as it becoming a clearer process, that has to go through the same process as every other piece of legislation. A legislative proposal has to come forward first, go to standing committee, and only then does it go to Cabinet, after which a bill would be drafted. Then, of course, at that point, further consultation takes place.

Closing the Municipal Funding Gap

2020-05-13 10:16:13,943 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. JACOBSON: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today, my questions are for the Minister of Municipal and Community Affairs. The report that the 18th Assembly did, I'm wondering if the Minister read the report. As the former Minister says, the MACA Minister, "I want to acknowledge that we are unable to definitively answer when and how the funding gap will be closed," in regard to the local community governments because of shortfalls there and people and communities are struggling. Does the Minister have any comments to this, Mr. Speaker? Thank you.

2020-05-13 10:16:13,961 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — For an example, the department intends to work with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources to support implementation of the NWT Waste Management Strategy. This strategy includes actions to support training and develop support to waste site operators, identifying funding to remove bulking hazardous waste from landfill sites, in order to extend the lifespan of the existing solid waste sites and working with the regional land and water boards to support tools which will assist community governments in managing their solid waste site in accordance with their water licence. The activities should improve on local waste management practices, but allow the government to support some of the cost to contribute to the community government. 
2020-05-13 10:16:13,972 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — Furthermore, MACA is working with the Department of Lands to develop and implement a process for the transfer of vacant Commissioner's lands to the community governments, which will take on authority and responsibility for land administration and provide potential own-source revenue for the sale of some land. The process will include such things as developing and implementing land administration training through MACA's School of Community Government to give community governments skills in land administration. 
2020-05-13 10:16:13,973 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — I want the Member to know that I am very mindful of the funding gap that does exist and the effect that is felt in the smaller communities, but I also want the Member to mindful that the departments are funded, and they do have to come up with their own capital plan and their budget of how they are going to be spending their money going forward. MACA is very open to what projects they're going to foresee, and we are there to support them through the process. We will be working very closely with the community governments.
2020-05-13 10:16:13,973 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. JACOBSON: That's a lot of good news for a question I did not ask, but I'm thankful to the Minister. Thank you so much; that's good news for me. Core funding, Mr. Speaker; that's what I was talking about. It's not the new funding. Our community governments are struggling, because we're getting less and less. It's not so much less and less; it's the cost of doing business in the community, right? Like, I sat on council for three years. We struggle, struggle, struggle. We stretch everything, Mr. Speaker.

We are trying to work with the community to look at other solutions of how they can collect revenue at the municipal level. We are very mindful of working with the solid-waste sites, the water stations, and making sure that we do have the quality of service and the safety of each of the communities.

The act itself requires about 18 different kinds of information to be posted. The establishment agreements for Thaidene Nene are not found there. A better model is to look at the Mackenzie Valley Land and Water Board or the review board's public registries.

Thaidene Nene wildlife conservation area lands withdrawal is not intended to be permanent and could be removed when there is an approved land use plan, when the land claims are settled. The GNWT aims to establish the Thaidene Nene wildlife conservation area under the Wildlife Act in regulations by February 2021.

I think there might be a little bit of a misunderstanding, here. My understanding is that the wildlife conservation area is going to be permanently protected and that the surface/subsurface is not going to be open for exploration, so I will be very curious to follow this along, because I don't think that's what the Minister said. However, earlier today, I said that the only public commitment of GNWT funding toward Thaidene Nene seems to be an annual appropriation of $290,000. The federal government has even committed to fund some of our costs. Can the Minister tell us: what specific capital and operations funding has our government committed toward Thaidene Nene moving forward in the future?

To answer his question, Environment and Climate Change Canada natural funding has provided $5.8 million over three years for the Thaidene Nene territorial protected areas. In addition, Parks Canada is providing $1 million in funding over the same three-year period. The Government of the Northwest Territories is committing $8.12 million of in-kind funding to the three protected areas identified under the nature fund. This in-kind funding is made up of operation, maintenance, and salaries. The GNWT is exploring operations to ensure stable funding beyond 2023 for the territorial protected areas, including an endowment fund and other natural base funding sources.

In the action plan, I see a lot of it is generated around changing community health nurse standards, community health nurse guidelines, pre-natal, post-natal. What I want to ask the Minister is: knowing we have shortage, and I know we have some really excellent community health nurses, but a lot of times, with the shortage, we don't have community health nurses; we have a lot of emergency room nurses going into the health centres. So, with all these changes that are in here, how do we expect these nurses to make sure that they are providing this oral healthcare, when that is not their background? Thank you.

SEMMLER: I understand who provides care, and I understand that dental service is not an insured service, but, like I said in my Member's statement, it affects so many insured services. We do provide health promotion and, according to the action plan, a lot of that is health promotion, and our front-line nurses do provide a lot of that. In the action plan, there is "new oral health positions using a phased-in approach," in the first year, 2018-2019; second year, 2019-2020; and a third year, 2020-2021. Where are those positions? Have those positions been created, and where are they so far?

We are right on the banks of the Mackenzie River, and we have many gas bars and tank farms along the river system in close proximity to the river. Of course, we have regulations for protection of the water, since water is life. My question to the Minister is: are there any regulations for fuel tank farms? Mahsi.

If we're not regulating the private tank farms that are in close proximity to the river, to the waterways, I don't know, why are we even here? We're the government. We have to set these regulations, even for private operators. I am wondering if the Minister can advise when we may see updated regulations to all tank farms, whether they're private or government-owned?

My understanding is that the federal storage tank regulations were developed in 2012, and we follow those moving forward. We do have regulations. We do inspect them, but, if people have concerns, they need to reach out to our inspectors so that we can check on these things.

We should have regulations in place that provide these services by the GNWT on a regular yearly basis, and it should be spelled out in any regulations before they do any further installations. I would like to ask the Minister: when can we see actual inspections of all tank farms in the very, very near future? Mahsi.

Again, the important thing is, I heard the Member say in his Member's statement that there are potential sites out there that are a problem. We just need to be told of that so that we can work on those things, so that we can identify them. Again, it's about working together. Even if it's on private land, if there is a potential spill or a situation, please reach out to us so that we can do the inspection. People can phone. There's a 1-800 number. There's a spill line.

Then we ran it again as a pilot project, which is just coming to an end. Can the Minster provide what the future of the integrated case management pilot project is? Is it going to become a program?

Cabinet hasn't made a conscious decision that says we are going to have a matrix-style of organization structure as such. We have discussed the issues of the integrated service delivery. One of the guiding principles that we actually tabled in the House here on December 10, 2019, says that we will evaluate, develop, and deliver programs and services using an integrated, client-focused, and solution-focused approach. People should not have to go to six different agencies, different departments, to actually get services. It is not okay. Sometimes the stories that people have to share are horrible, and it is not okay to have to keep bringing them up all the time. We recognize that.

I can't say about the 17th. I wasn't part of that one. In the 18th, I know that we had a number of different departments that had working groups that worked across departments. We had deputy ministers' groups that took different issues. Our own committee of Cabinet had different committees that looked at all different Ministers with an integrated approach. That is being carried forward into this government. Again, we don't have anything that is structured, that is written down, that is organizational at this point.

The previous questions were about integrated case management. It kind of falls in, appropriately, to this question again. When we were doing the integrated case management, there was a lot of research done on it. The previous government, again, started this. They looked at models such as the New Brunswick framework on the delivery of integrated services for children and youth, as well as models in New Zealand. There are important lessons to be learned from other jurisdictions. Best practice says you don't always keep reinventing the wheel. You look at the wheel that is there and make sure it doesn't need any repairs. That is being done.

We can do research for the sake of research; we can do studies for the sake of studies and plans for the sake of plans. However, we have done this research. We have the program running. It is just been evaluated now. I would suggest, honourably, that we hold back for a minute from doing more research and see what the evaluations come up with first. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

2020-05-13 10:16:14,159 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MS. GREEN: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. My questions are for the Minister of Industry, Tourism and Investment. Aurora tourism is a major component of the NWT tourism industry, and Chinese tourists accounted for about 20 percent of all the tourists who came to the NWT last year. Last month, the Chinese government suspended group tours because of the risk of spreading the corona virus. My question is: does the Minister have any information on the impact of the coronavirus shutdown on tourism? Mahsi.

However, at this time, we don't have those numbers in front of us, and we don't feel like we will really have the full picture until likely around the fall of this year, when we can look at the numbers for the season and see where we are at. I would like to remind that, while we do have a lot of Chinese visitors and they do play an important role in our tourism sector, we do have people coming from other locations around the world. While this will impact our tourism sectors and we will feel the impact, we still feel we will have a robust, vibrant tourism season. Thank you.

2020-05-13 10:16:14,173 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. KATRINA NOKLEBY: Fair enough. I may be a little bit optimistic in using the word "vibrant," and I acknowledge that. I would like to hope that we will continue to see a good season. However, I do acknowledge what the Member is saying in that there is no way I could predict that at this time. Again, I also cannot fully answer what metrics will be collected. Obviously, we will be looking at things like direct impacts to airfare, cancellations on airlines; we will be looking at asking the hotels, et cetera, to provide numbers for their types of cancellations, and such; so I assume that there will be a fairly robust data collection. I am committed to sharing that with the Member when I get that information going forward.

As we start to collect the data and we can analyze it and look, we will commit to updating the Members as we progress through that data analysis, and I will commit to it being a robust data collection.

So it is our plan to continue with marketing toward China and Chinese tourists. As well, we will work with the Chinese tourism counterparts to ensure that we can communicate with them that we want them to come to the Northwest Territories, that we are still committed to them as a marketplace for our tourism products, and that we will work closely with them and help to facilitate the exchange of information between the two countries.

2020-05-13 10:16:17,248 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — I will move on to a third question. I am assuming, as with any other government contract, that the process will follow to favour northern hires, northern businesses. What was the process that allowed a non-Tlicho, not just a non-NWT, but rather an American firm to service the Tlicho All-Season Road project, especially when they are operating in Monfwi borders?
2020-05-13 10:16:17,248 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. KATRINA NOKLEBY: I would agree with the Member that we have all had lots of discussions around ensuring that northern businesses are used on northern contracts. I can't speak to the specifics of knowing, in this particular contract, details, but it is my understanding from the department that this has all been within the contract that was set forward and negotiated between the Government of the Northwest Territories and the Tlicho as well as the third party. It is my understanding that that was all decided upon together as a group. I am concerned to hear of businesses that are coming from not only southern Canada but from the US and taking work. It is definitely something I spoke to during my campaign. All I can do is commit to the Member that we will look at this and learn lessons from this and move forward.

There is no advertising in the communities or on the radio, and we are always having the staff of the LHOs directing clients to the Hay River office because we don't have anyone in our community to help with those. Because it's important for the seniors; they are always missing the end dates, or it's too late in the winter for servicing furnaces, and whatever else is required, so it's important to have those staff people on the ground in their communities who can help, maybe go door-to-door to really assist people. Mahsi cho.

In July 2019, the practice of allowing family members was changed so that family members could not be in the same room as a patient who was getting an ultrasound, so why was that practice changed in July of 2019?

2020-05-13 10:16:17,346 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. DIANE THOM: The change was based on updated Sonography Canada Professional Practice Guidelines and feedback from the diagnostic imaging staff. This approach is evolving to become the standard practice in Canada and, at the time it was implemented, it was viewed by the diagnostic imaging department to be an internal procedural change. It is recognized, however, that this was short-sighted and did not necessarily anticipate the viewpoint and concerns of the public. As such, Stanton has committed to properly engage with practitioners, patients, and community stakeholders to discuss the intent of the practice change and impact that it may have.

2020-05-13 10:16:17,355 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — Ultrasounds are medical exams that require full attention of the sonographers. Additional people in the room can make the exam more challenging. The intention was to allow the sonographer to complete the medical portion of the exam first, before inviting the patient's family into the room to show them and provide them with a photo of the baby.
2020-05-13 10:16:17,368 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. O'REILLY: I want to thank the Minister for that explanation. Look, it's great that our staff are -- and I know that they work very hard at Stanton Hospital, but clearly, when a policy like this is decided internally, it's probably not in the best interests of the patients. I have reviewed the Sonography Canada Professional Practice Guidelines; in fact, I quoted from them in my Member's statement. They were released in September of 2018, and there was nothing in there about northern healthcare or any specific guidance to exclude family members during an ultrasound. Would the Minister confirm that the guidelines that I just referenced, and she has referenced, do not prevent family members from being present during an ultrasound?

If this amount is exceeded, the education body has to put forward a plan on how they are going to reduce that, and that plan comes to me.

There are no promotions. We are all here to represent the public. I am happy to work with the education authorities to find ways to ensure that they can use their funds to deliver education in the best possible way. We also have to look at the fact that the funding from ECE is provided to the education council, and the education council is the one that then distributes it to the education authorities.

As I mentioned in my statement, helping seniors to age in place is a priority for this Assembly, but we need to improve supports for them to make this priority a reality. One area that needs work is helping Yellowknife seniors to get out of the House and socialize, whatever their physical and cognitive abilities. The Department of Health and Social Services surveyed seniors about the kinds of activities that they would like to take part in. Today, I have questions for the Minister about the results. First of all, what did seniors say they need in order to participate in social activities? Thank you.

The results indicated that older adults in Yellowknife are active and want to remain physically and socially active. All the age groups identified transportation, affordability of activities, and a lack of information about social activities as a barrier to social engagement. By far, the biggest concern was transportation: city bus not being available when activities are scheduled, routines are not close enough to home, and numerous challenges with the Yellowknife Accessible Transit Services. In addition, those 75 years and older identified lack of accessibility within buildings and lack of supports in physical and mental health needs as barriers to social engagement.

The Northwest Territories commercial fishing industry is eligible to receive funding and support from ITI in two different areas: the Great Slave Lake fishery support program, which is specifically for commercial fishers on Great Slave Lake and primarily to offset freight costs from Hay River to the Freshwater Fish Marketing Corporation plant in Winnipeg, Manitoba; and the second one is the Northern Food Development Program. As entrepreneurs and small businesses, fishers are also eligible to apply for funding from the Support for Entrepreneurs and Economic Development Program, or the SEED Program, which many already do.

2020-05-13 10:16:17,512 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — When it comes to the Great Slave Lake fishery support program, all fishers who hold a commercial fishing licence on Great Slave Lake, a current boat certificate, and sell fish to the Northwest Territories Fishermen's Federation fish plant are eligible to receive support under the freight support stream. This program pays out based on the poundage of fish delivered to the plant. Under this program, there was one non-resident fisher who received contributions last year, totalling about 2.5 percent of the total payout to fishers. 
2020-05-13 10:16:17,513 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. ROCKY SIMPSON: With respect to the residency requirement, there seems to be a difference between what is in the SEED Program and what is in the commercial renewable resource use policy. The SEED Program requires six months, and the other one is three years. I am just wondering if the Minister has looked at that and if the Minister is willing to reconcile that difference, because I would rather see the money stay in the North. I would rather see it be three years than the six-month requirement due to the fact that it is pretty easy to get a driver's licence here and it is pretty easy to get healthcare here. Anybody could do it and take our money and leave.

This is often a misunderstood issue, and it provides me with an opportunity to clarify the role of the clinicians in the administration of medical travel benefits. While our clinicians have an integral role with respect to medical travel, such as making a valid medical referral for the patient and making a recommendation for the escorts, medical travel assistance is a benefit program offered by our government and administered by our medical travel staff. The Medical Travel Policy does not give our clinicians full authority over escort decisions. The criteria for non-medical escorts are stated in the policy, and recommendations for an escort must be aligned with the criteria of the policy.

2020-05-13 10:16:17,558 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. DIANE THOM: The role of the medical travel office is to ensure that the Medical Travel Policy is being administered consistently and as intended by the policy. When a clinician makes a recommendation for a non-medical escort, the reason for the escort is written on the form and often accompanied by a letter providing further explanation. I have full confidence in the medical travel office's ability to determine if the reason aligns with the criteria that is listed in the policy. When medical travel staff deny coverage for non-medical escort benefits, there is often a follow-up communication between the clinician and the medical travel staff to confirm the escort decision. There are also an exceptions policy and appeals policy to consider unique circumstances and to ensure the policy is being applied as intended.

However, doctors have a role as advocates for their patients, and sometimes make recommendations for non-medical escorts that do not align with the criteria in the policy and would lead to significant inconsistencies in the benefits provided to one patient over another.

They are very simple principles, and our issue is that there has to be some kind of standard of care or principles that go across. It's not as easy as just changing them to meet the whim. We also have to take Canada's legislation, as well. For example, the Canada Health Act has principles that need to be taken into account. The new Canada legislation that is coming out with Child and Family Services has principles and standards that have to be taken into consideration. Although we want to work closely with our Indigenous governments, and we are looking at a new way of doing business, we can't forget that there are three parties at this table, often, with the negotiations: the Northwest Territories, the Indigenous government, and Canada.

The Government of the Northwest Territories took this approach to preserve the security originally accepted by Canada and to maximize its value.

Mr. Speaker, the Affirmative Action Policy is one tool that the Government of the Northwest Territories uses to ensure that we have a representative workforce, and in so doing, in addition to having that policy and having that in place for all hiring across the Northwest Territories, there are efforts made in the course of the careers recruitment process to provide assistance. There is a help section within the website and within the department that could assist individuals in terms of resume writing and can assist them with interview preparation. In addition to that, there are officers within the department of human resources that can assist with maintaining and following the Affirmative Action Policy to see that it is, in fact, working as hard as it can.

I can confirm, Mr. Speaker, I have already requested and received a briefing on specifically the issue of the Affirmative Action Policy from the department. It, certainly, is on the radar, if I might say so in that way, that it is something the department is alive to, and that there may be a need to modernize that policy. For the moment, the next step would simply be to do that work within the department, and to bring it to Cabinet to see that it does see action within the next Assembly, if considered appropriate.

For example, the Indigenous Career Gateway Program is an opportunity for Indigenous candidates to be given training in order to assume positions within the GNWT. Regional Recruitment Program is another opportunity that is meant to link opportunities that come available within regions and to identify when there is an opportunity that requires some training in order to help a person become eligible for that position. Indigenous Management Development and Training Program, that is an opportunity for individuals already within the GNWT's public service to see that they have appropriate skills and training so that they can continue to advance their careers within the GNWT.

The purpose of this workshop is to teach women from across the Northwest Territories how to teach the Campaign School for Women. By increasing the number of trained facilitators who can provide this training, more workshops can be delivered and the content can focus on more specific regional community concerns. A call for expression was advertised, inviting potential facilitators to submit their names to take part in the facilitators' workshop. Up to 15 regional community participants will be selected. Once this workshop is complete, the Women's Advisory Office will work with the trained facilitators to schedule workshops to be held in all the regions in this calendar year.

My understanding is that there will be wide-spread campaign schools and they will be offered by local people. One of the things that I was told, and the Premier was told when we were offering campaign schools, is that it was useful to have people who were in elected office be part of the teaching group so that there was the "see it, be it" dynamic there, that people could meet actual politicians doing the job. Is there any provision for this kind of "see it, be it" dynamic to continue in the campaign schools?

2020-05-13 10:16:19,328 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. BONNETROUGE: From what I understand and what I have been approached by, they are required to have a bank account because part of the process to get Income Security is the Income Security employee needs the bank statement. That is what I understand of that program, and that is what is stressing out many of the clients, especially the ones who aren't working. There are some of the seniors who are involved in that, too, and they are not meeting their obligations to pay their rent. That is why I asked that, because I understand that they are being sent away from the Income Security office to go get someone else to help them print those bank statements. That would be my next question to the Minister, is if their employees are required, if they are opening the bank accounts, to assist with inquiring and printing bank statements for the clients.

2020-05-13 10:16:19,351 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. JOHNSON: That one charge, I believe, points to the larger systemic issue that it is not worth pursuing a prosecution under our Residential Tenancies Act, as presently the maximum fine available to a corporation is $25,000. I talked about Northview earlier today; $25,000 is not even a rounding error on a multi-million-dollar corporation. My question for the Minister of Justice is: is the $25,000 fine for corporations under our Residential Tenancies Act consistent with best practices?

To my knowledge, there are only two provinces or territories that have significantly higher fines, and a third, namely Quebec, that has a fine set at $29,000. We are in line with what is happening in other jurisdictions.

2020-05-13 10:16:19,363 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. JOHNSON: One of the issues with fines is that, in a residential tenancies dispute between a landlord and a tenant, the fine then goes to the GNWT, which doesn't necessarily resolve the issue. Under more recent legislation in the Northwest Territories, we have provided territorial judges with a suite of remedial powers, such as orders that would allow some of that money to then go to the tenant in the dispute. Is it best practice to provide our territorial judges with remedial powers under the Residential Tenancies Act?

2020-05-13 10:16:19,364 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. CAROLINE WAWZONEK: The powers under the Residential Tenancies Act were recently transferred from being restricted to the Territorial Court to Supreme Court, which certainly did increase the suite of options available to judges and improve the options in terms of their enforceability. The Residential Tenancies Act is aimed at essentially settling disputes between individuals who have civil disputes. Certainly, the suggestion that there should be powers more akin to criminal law powers is not going to be appropriate or even possible within the jurisdiction of the act. To that extent, in my view, it is already doing what it can to provide options for tenants to take action and to enforce their orders and to do so within the powers that are available within our court services.

If we do have some units that we are able to repair, then we do consult with the community members first and if communities have interest, if they would be interested in taking over the units. If the conditions are beyond repair, we end up demolishing the properties, and we do end up rebuilding either under the home-ownership program or else the public-housing units. Thank you, Member.

2020-05-13 10:16:19,462 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. KATRINA NOKLEBY: Selling the Mactung deposit together with the Cantung Mine allows prospective buyers to evaluate and propose a more comprehensive tungsten business plan that could possibly include economically feasible mining operations, remediation, as well as exploration. This approach is more attractive to responsible developers and increases the potential viability of renewed tungsten mining operations in the Northwest Territories. Our priority is to identify and establish an experienced proponent whose proposed business model will maximize benefits to Northwest Territories residents and businesses.

There is a difference between the appointing of statutory appointments and employment contracts; totally different. There are actually a number of statutory appointments across the Government of the Northwest Territories. The appointment process appoints the individual to a position in the public service; statutory appointments are made by the Minister and assigns responsibility under the legislation. In some cases, a position may have more than one statutory appointment. For example, the territory executive director, who is not hired by the Minister, for Child and Family Services, in addition to their employment contract, is conferred through appointment by the Minister of Health and Social Services. The statutory appointment of director, Child and Family Services, is under the Child and Family Services Act and the director of adoptions under the Adoptions Act, so that Minister appoints the statutory positions but is not responsible for hiring.

Are they going to keep the local contractors, the plumbers, and everybody at work?

Mr. Speaker, it is troubling that the Minister of Education, Culture and Employment played no role in the recent Aurora College president dismissal and that, in fact, he was not consulted. The Minister admitted publicly. There is a lot of confusion on this side of the House and from the public, and the public wants answers.

2020-05-13 10:16:19,548 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — Mr. Speaker, this raises concerns regarding the legal propriety of the president's termination. I would like to refer back to the Aurora College Act, which has authority over the hiring and firing of the president exclusively with the Minister responsible for the college and not the Premier, section 19 of the act. Mr. Speaker, the first question I have is: we have so many acts here in the Northwest Territories passed in this House by Members of the Legislative Assembly. One of them happens to be the Aurora College Act. Mr. Speaker, once these acts are passed in the House, doesn't it become law that we follow as the Government of the Northwest Territories?

My interpretation of the Aurora College Act says that the Minister is responsible for "appointing" a president, different terminology. It does not say "firing," at all, or "terminating."

2020-05-13 10:16:19,562 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — As I stated earlier, there are many positions. The employment contract of an associate deputy minister or a deputy minister remain with the Premier. There are many departments across that actually will appoint statutory appointments that are not responsible for the employment contract. No Minister that I know of, except for hiring their secretaries or their special advisors, they do not hire employees into the public service. However, once people are hired into the public service, that Minister may appoint people that are in the public service to statutory positions. Again, that Minister is not responsible for the employment contract. The employment contract is under the department's perusal within that. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
2020-05-13 10:16:19,563 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. LAFFERTY: In my eyes, this is a law that we follow in this House and also out of this House, as government. Section 19.1 of the Aurora College Act: "The Minister shall, in consultation with the board, appoint a president of Aurora College." So, when a former Minister appointed the president, there was no call to the board. Was that legit? But that is another discussion, another topic of the day because we are beyond that. With this act, it clearly states that the Minister responsible shall appoint with consultation for the board. I just want to make the process clear. Why did the Premier overstep her authority by dismissing the president of Aurora College when it is, in fact, the law it is Minister's job, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment, to do so?

In fact, we have had more legal opinions on this than not. The Premier is responsible for hiring and terminating associate deputy ministers and deputy ministers. Appointments to positions are not contingent on the Minister having to hire or terminate. There are many statutory positions that the Minister is not responsible for hiring. In fact, very few positions can a Minister hire for. We are blending in two things that should not be blended.

2020-05-13 10:16:19,565 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. LAFFERTY: Just going forward with the process itself, if the Premier of the day can overstep the decision of the education Minister, what is stopping her from doing so with other departments, other statutes that are before us? Again, I have to remind this House that we are dealing with the law that we passed in this House with sitting Legislative Assembly Members. This is a very critical issue that we have to be clear for the public. I am still confused with the process because there is a Minister here, and the Premier makes a decision over top of the Minister responsible for Aurora College to deliver those under her act.

There might have been a discussion, but the decision to overrule the Minister's authority is in question in this House. Section 19.1, "Minister shall, in consultation with the board, appoint the president of Aurora College." Clearly, it lays out, Mr. Speaker, and here, we have a Premier that came down to say, "I don't like this. We are going to change this." There are other statutes, other committees, other organizations, departments that are in a similar boat. Are we going to go to allow the Premier to call the shots at the end of the day to say if she likes it or not? The Ministers are given authority to appoint or dismiss.

2020-05-13 10:16:19,582 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — Mr. Speaker, I am still confused with the whole process, and I am not happy with what happened, the process itself, if I were given authority to the Ministers, six Ministers, to operate their department according to the act that we have in place. That doesn't seem to be the case. I am kind of worried and concerned in that area. With that, Mr. Speaker, I just want to lay it out because the public needs to know the process itself. Masi.
2020-05-13 10:16:19,582 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. CAROLINE COCHRANE: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Again, discussions were had. This wasn't made on my own. It was a decision that I made. I hire. I terminate. That is done on my authority, but there is consultation that happened within that. I must also point out when people are appointed into positions such as boards, presidents, et cetera, that the Minister doesn't hire for but appoints, the Minister also has a time after that. There is usually a 60-day period that you can actually revoke those board appointments or presidents, et cetera. The termination of an employee or board member, et cetera, does not necessarily mean that you have to wait until they are revoked from their position as a board member. If that was the case, we would have board members throughout the Northwest Territories that would actually be having to get honorariums, paycheques, after their termination. The termination is separate than the appointment. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

With the stick-built units, I know they are just a little bit more expensive than just putting the modular units on the ground. There is no plan to construct the modular units at this time.

2020-05-13 10:16:21,267 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. LAFFERTY: Masi, Mr. Speaker. [Translation] When I talked earlier, I mentioned about alcohol and addiction, how to do treatment for people. [Translation ends] The first question I have is: what programs are currently in place here in the Northwest Territories to provide addiction treatment and addiction recovery care? How many programs are there in total? Masi, Mr. Speaker.

2020-05-13 10:16:21,276 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. DIANE THOM: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today, I would like to talk about the Mental Wellness and Addictions Recovery Action Plan that supports the priorities of this 19th Assembly by increasing the number and variety of culturally respectful, community-based mental health and addictions programs, including after-care. I would also like to address the Member's question on what are the types of programming that we have for mental health and addictions.

2020-05-13 10:16:21,278 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — We have a number of programs, Mr. Speaker, including the Community Counselling Program. We also have the Northwest Territories helpline. We have facility-based addictions treatments. We have the On-the-Land Healing Fund. We also have a program for family violence shelters. We have a "What Will It Take?" family violence campaign. We also deliver prevention-promotion workshops, including mental health, first aid, and applied suicide intervention skills training; also, "Talking About Mental Illness." 
2020-05-13 10:16:21,278 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. LAFFERTY: I was strictly referring to addiction treatment and addiction recovery care. However, I will move on to the second question, on-the-land treatment programs. How many on-the-land treatment programs do we currently have in the Northwest Territories and where are they located?

My fourth and final question is: the Truth and Reconciliation Commission call to action has 23 calls upon all levels of government, including the territorial government, to increase the number of Aboriginal professionals, retention of Aboriginal professional healthcare, and also training for all those health professionals. Do we currently have in place all these areas of interest that have been highlighted as part of the calls to action in our communities, in our 33 communities, Mr. Speaker? Masi.

When I first took over this portfolio, I soon after became aware that we would be receiving a report of the Office of the Auditor General. Personally, I was happy to have this at the beginning of my term because, as a former Regular Member, I was on the committee that looked at these reports and I know how valuable they are.

2020-05-13 10:16:21,311 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — I am happy to have the information. I wish I could say that it was a glowing audit. It wasn't scathing, but it obviously shows that we are not doing as well as we would like and that we can do better. There are certain areas that are more concerning than others, mainly because we made progress in some areas that have happened since the report. For example, the languages; we have done much since the Auditor finished the report that wasn't reflected in there. 
2020-05-13 10:16:21,312 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — There are things like the graduation rate, which was mentioned earlier. There is no universally accepted way to calculate graduation rates, but you never want to see something that shows that you are not graduating half your population. There is nothing in there that I can say is shocking to me. I have been a Member. I have talked to people in the community. I hear the concerns about education. We are very concerned. We are developing plans to move forward. 
2020-05-13 10:16:21,313 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — I want to also state that the Member noted that we are treating our students no better than cows to a slaughterhouse. I just wanted to comment that, when a student goes into a classroom, teachers treat them much better than cows to slaughter. We have a dedicated staff. We have about 800 teachers in the territory. I want to let them know that I support them and I support their efforts. Going forward, I am going to make sure that we hear from them and we hear how to make these things better. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
2020-05-13 10:16:21,314 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. JACOBSON: Let's just get this straight, too. I support my staff in the communities, in my riding, and across the territory. I sat on the education committee in my home community of Tuktoyaktuk for the last three-and-a-half years, and I support them. I support my youth, my youth who ECE is failing. It is not this Minister's fault. It is prior. At the end of the day, the department has to be committed to adopting a more accurate method in getting graduation rates in the NWT, to get more information broken down by the riding. That is all I am asking for. We have our haves and have-nots in our ridings. In the small communities, we are have-nots.

2020-05-13 10:16:21,316 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — The department has looked at the methodology they use to calculate graduation rates, and we have made a change that more accurately reflects what you would call a true graduation rate, even though there really is no such thing. Different jurisdictions use different rates. 
2020-05-13 10:16:21,317 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — For the territory, we have a lot of in-and-out migration. We have a small population. There is nothing that suits us perfectly. We tried looking at other graduation rates around the country. When we applied them to our situation, some groups of our population were graduating at over 100 percent. Clearly, it is not a cookie-cutter approach. We have created a method now that more accurately reflects, I think, the number of students we have graduating. 
2020-05-13 10:16:21,318 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — To the Member's point about this data collection, we have also created a framework regarding this data collection. We are going to begin reporting yearly on a lot of these indicators. I know that this is the second report, and the first report made lots of comments about the lack of data. This one makes those notes, as well. I have to say that we have come a long way in 10 years, and we have even come a long way since the work on this report was completed. 
2020-05-13 10:16:21,330 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — We now have a lot of that data that we did not have before. The thing we have to do now is analyze it and figure out exactly what it is telling us. Education is difficult because you can have the best teacher and you can have the best facilities in a class, but there is a lot going on outside that classroom. There is a lot going on in students' lives. It is hard to say, "This program, is it helping students effectively?"
2020-05-13 10:16:21,330 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — Those are the kind of things that this data is going to help us with. We are going to develop our program so that we know that it is working, so that we can do a better job serving our students. 
2020-05-13 10:16:21,331 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. JACOBSON: Education is key to our success in our territory and to our people and to our youth, because our youth are our future. Will the Minister make a commitment to the Assembly to provide a draft copy of the department's implementation plan in advance so the standing committee can have a public hearing?

2020-05-13 10:16:21,346 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. R.J. SIMPSON: The term "social passing" is a bit of a misnomer. Students aren't passed into the next grade. They are placed in the next grade. If they don't achieve, if they do not get the credits, if they don't do the work that they need to pass, they do not pass. They are placed in the next grade with their peer group, and they have lesson plans that are adjusted in order to meet that.

2020-05-13 10:16:21,347 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — I am not going to commit to eliminating social passing because, right now, there is no requirement for a student who doesn't achieve a certain level to be placed in the next grade. That is a decision made by the administrators, by the teachers, and by the school after they have a conversation. Every parent and student has a right to remain in a grade. If a parent and his teacher feels like the child needs to stay in grade 4 or 5 for a second time around, then that is their right. They can have that conversation, and they can do that. 
2020-05-13 10:16:21,348 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — What I do commit to is working to better prepare students so that this doesn't become an issue. If we focus our efforts on early childhood and we ensure that students don't fall behind, we ensure that, when a student comes out of JK, kindergarten, grade 1, grade 2, and they are at those levels, we are not going to have to worry about social passing anymore because they are going to have the skills and ability to pass on their own merits. That is what I commit to. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

2020-05-13 10:16:21,368 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — After speaking with stakeholders the last several months, I recognized that there is a need to improve upon the Government of the Northwest Territories procurement and the Business Incentive Policy. The Departments of ITI and Infrastructure are working to address this and are looking for areas in which we can strengthen the government's procurement processes. We continue to offer training to increase awareness of our contracting opportunities and of the procurement process. In fact, workshops were held in January in Norman Wells, Tulita, and Hay River. 
2020-05-13 10:16:21,380 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — We have committed to a review of procurement generally and the BIP specifically.

2020-05-13 10:16:21,380 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. ROCKY SIMPSON: The next question has to do with payment to contractors. We find that, in talking with a number of contractors, they have been waiting for payment for up to five, six, seven, eight, nine months. What I would like to ask the Minister is: what will your department do to ensure that our northern businesses are paid in a timely manner for work done?

As the Minister of Infrastructure is aware from my opening statement regarding the transmission line from the Taltson Hydro to my community of Fort Providence, I just wanted to raise a fact that I just looked at. 
2020-05-13 10:16:21,403 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — Previous question.
2020-05-13 10:16:21,412 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — Speaker:[MR. BONNETROUGE] Dialog chars: [234] prev_question:[True]
2020-05-13 10:16:21,412 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — The cost of transmission power in Fort Smith is currently at 23 cents a kilowatt hour. When I was there in 2006, it was 17 cents a kilowatt hour, and they were able to put electrical baseboard heaters in units without having to deal with diesel appliances, the furnaces, and stuff. In my community of Fort Providence, we're on diesel. We are on a diesel plant, and before the territorial subsidy rate, which is about half, covers it, the rate in Fort Providence is 84 cents a kilowatt hour. 
2020-05-13 10:16:21,413 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — There is a significant difference there before the government rebates come on. We are paying pretty high, and the government is on the hook for paying all of that, too, because they are subsidizing the whole territory for power. Like I alluded to, there's no watchdog. There is nobody actually talking to our own power corporation, the NTPC, either, about what they're doing to help the territory save on power. That's my concern there. 
2020-05-13 10:16:21,414 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — Anyway, getting back to the transmission line to Fort Providence, can the Minister provide an update on the initiative to run the line into Kakisa and Fort Providence? Mahsi.

However, I can provide the Member with an update on the Kakisa transmission line, Fort Providence to Kakisa. It is a key initiative of our 2030 Energy Strategy. It roughly represents about 15 percent of our total reduction target for electricity generation. The proposed $52-million project involves the construction of the 170-kilometre line from Taltson to Fort Providence, Kakisa, and Dory Point. The extent of the project is to use the surplus hydroelectric power from the Taltson system, the existing system, to virtually eliminate the use for diesel generation in the communities. There will be still emergency backup that would be diesel-generated.

2020-05-13 10:16:21,417 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — The delivery of hydro power to the customers in these communities should eliminate about one million litres of diesel consumption each year and will help us reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. This project is one of the best projects that we have under the 2030 Energy Strategy in terms of greenhouse gas reductions, and without it, the Northwest Territories cannot meet its commitments that we have made. 
2020-05-13 10:16:21,418 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — The Government of the Northwest Territories has already set aside its 25-percent share towards the funding of the project, and we will be seeking 75-percent funding through the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program this year. There are over $250 million in federal funding allocated to energy projects in the Northwest Territories over the next 10 years under the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program. The Government of the Northwest Territories must apply separately for federal approval for each individual project. The proposed routing for the transmission line is to follow the highway from Hay River to Fort Providence, with an extension into Kakisa and the Dory Point area. The Government of the Northwest Territories will be initiating appropriate engagement and consultation activities on this project in early 2020. Once consultation has been initiated, the Government of the Northwest Territories will apply for federal funding under the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program, we will undertake the environmental baseline work, and we will undertake the detailed engineering design and costing.

In the federal government, they have a gazetting process that does allow for a 60- or 90-day period of public comment. We have nothing here, apparently, or a patchwork. I want to ask the Minister whether Cabinet has a position or has taken a position on public consultation during development of regulations, particularly the regulations on post-devolution resource management.

As far as what that will look like, at the present time I can't say, but it is our intention that we can have a better system in place to determine, as I said earlier, which regulations should be subject to public consultation, what that process would look like. It is our intention to build that in so that it's more clear, so that the public knows, so that this House will know, which regulations would be subject to a consultation and then what that will look like for those particular regulations.

That protocol is also being worked on, and so, again, I am in the same situation of, while I do not have a specific that I can provide to the Member, I can assure the Member that that is in progress and it is actively being worked on right now to develop some things so we have some standards in place and so there is not this uncertainty around which ones are subject to a more consultative type of drafting process and which ones are not. That kind of uncertainty should be eliminated.

There are two different streams we have spoken about; firstly, more public consultation and developing that process for all regulations generally to determine which ones go through that process and which ones don't, as well as items that go through the intergovernmental council, and that may be subject to somewhat different processes. Certainly, once there is a stage for which regulations should receive general public consultation, I would commit to taking that through to committee and ensuring that they have an opportunity before a final decision is made to see what the approach, what the protocol, might look like.

We have to combat 150 years of degradation of Indigenous languages in the territory, and it's tough, especially when the numbers of speakers are dwindling. You know, we have a division within the department that is focusing on this. They are very passionate about it, and they have been making strides to work with Indigenous governments and work within schools by helping to develop curriculum, which we are rolling out across the territory in the next couple of years, and it will be fully implemented. The action plan that is being developed in response to the OAG's report as well as our own internal findings will address these and flesh these out a bit more. We are going to be looking to renegotiate or negotiate a new agreement with the federal government regarding money for languages. However, we can't do this alone. The government can't solve all problems, especially when it comes to something as close to people and as vital to culture as language, so partnerships are going to be key.

We are going to see that. There is a group of kids out there who have access to more quality education earlier, and that is going to pay big dividends going forward. We have things like the child and youth care counsellors, which are rolling out across the territory, to help students with issues that hinder their ability to learn. We have a territorial support team, which teachers and administrators can reach out to so that they can get help with things like mental health. We have an educational psychologist, an occupational therapist, behavioural specialist, a speech-language pathologist all on staff to help teachers work with students to address some of their needs. 
2020-05-13 10:16:21,502 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — Clearly, more needs to be done, and I am willing to look at different ways of proceeding with this. Inclusive schooling social passing is controversial, but the other option is that students don't get placed in the next grade. They just get held back, and the consequence of that is higher dropout rates. We want to find that ground where we are not losing students to dropout, but we are adequately preparing them. We are working on it. I look forward to getting into more detail as we go forward, as we develop this action plan, but I am committed to providing more supports.

There are many Indigenous governments, actually, that are moving into doing housing projects. I will give an example of the Inuvialuit Regional Corporation who, in the last Assembly, actually did a partnership with the Housing Corporation. The Inuvialuit Corporation received funding from the federal government. They worked closely with the NWT Housing Corporation to define the housing needs of people in their region. Then both the Inuvialuit Regional Corporation and NWT Housing Corporation worked together in making sure the project was on the ground.

2020-05-13 10:16:21,575 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — This government is committed to doing more and more partnerships like that. The previous government had always felt, in fairness, that the money should come through the GNWT to allocate to Indigenous governments to have control over the housing, make sure the needs were being met, et cetera. This government is taking a different stance. We have already talked to the federal government in that we are actually totally fine in actually advocating if the federal government gives the housing money to the Indigenous governments, that we will work with them either on their own or if they want our support. 
2020-05-13 10:16:21,576 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — It is not about competition. This is about getting houses in the North. We need to stop any kind of competition that that means and keep the priority that every person deserves a home. 
2020-05-13 10:16:21,577 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MS. CLEVELAND: Does the government have a timeline of when they would like to put together housing plans with each Indigenous government, and is there a desire to do one specifically and independently with each Indigenous government?

2020-05-13 10:16:21,578 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. CAROLINE COCHRANE: Absolutely. The commitment to actually do community housing plans in each community was a commitment actually from the last Assembly. I remember the Housing Minister bringing that forward. During this Assembly, I know that they have just finished one with the community of Whati. As they move forward, the goal is to have community housing plans in every community, because it is inappropriate for a government or any individual to believe that one size fits all. Every community has distinct strengths and distinct challenges. If we are doing services under best practices, we work with communities, not telling communities what to do.

2020-05-13 10:16:21,583 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — We need to work with Indigenous governments. That is what we have done in the last Assembly and carrying forward so that we work in partnership, where there is a community housing program that the GNWT puts in either labour or materials and the community government, either Indigenous or community, can put in a portion, as well, either labour or things. Those are ideas we need to keep forward. 
2020-05-13 10:16:21,583 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — We need to work in partnership.

2020-05-13 10:16:21,617 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MS. GREEN: I appreciate that answer from the Minister. It is a surprising answer to me because it was my understanding that the Stanton nursing workforce was 280 individuals. The Minister is saying 185 full-time equivalents is, in fact, the total number. There is some mismatch there, which we need to get at, which is: what is the total workforce, and what is the vacancy rate within that? I realize the Minister may not have that information to hand. Let me move on with whether the number of new hires has allowed nurses to reduce their overtime and to plan for holidays and vacations. Has overtime cost gone down?

The building was not maintaining temperatures, parts of the building. Cold air was being sucked into the building. Metal doors on the exterior of the building were frosting. In order to resolve these issues, Dexterra investigated and resolved air supply issues. Additional investigation is scheduled for spring of 2020. An additional heater was added in the emergency entrance. There was resequencing to the two sets of sliding doors. Those are a number of the issues that were done, and I respect that the staff up at the Stanton hospital had to go through this. I went up there and was able to speak to some of the staff, not all of the staff, but just to reassure them that this is something that the department is looking into. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

In response to an earlier question, she did commit to consulting with the standing committee in looking at how the public would be engaged in the future around regulation making. That is great, but she did not say anything about co-drafting and whether she would be consulting with standing committee on that. I just want to remind her that, in the last Assembly, the Standing Committee on Economic Development and Environment developed a whole report around co-drafting, with lots of recommendations, ideas about how to improve that process going forward, including the involvement of standing committee. I would like to know from the Minister of Justice whether she is prepared to work with the Standing Committee on Economic Development and Environment moving forward in looking at how Indigenous governments are going to be involved in co-drafting of regulations. Mahsi, Mr. Speaker.

Quite frankly, the reason is that, if I make a commitment in this House, I am going to take it very seriously, and I understand that co-drafting and the involvement of the Indigenous governments, the involvement of the intergovernmental council, involves EIA, involves Cabinet, involves more than just the Department of Justice, and so I was not prepared to stand up and make that specific commitment here. Nevertheless, I can certainly commit to working with standing committee, making sure that I am personally briefed and aware of what is in that report, and so, to that extent, we will move forward, but that is about as far as I am prepared to go today, Mr. Speaker.

I have heard a number of times from the Member that nothing is going on in this Assembly since we have been elected. I want to remind the Member that this Cabinet has only been elected since November, so it's only a few, it's not six months that I have heard many times. We might have been campaigning six months ago, but the Cabinet has only been around since November. I take offence at saying nothing is going on. We are working on our mandate commitments based on the priorities of the 19th Legislative Assembly, but I need to say that the priorities are only what is extra. Day-to-day business within government programs goes on every day. Whether we are here sitting in this House or whether we are back in our constituencies or whether Ministers are upstairs running their departments, day-to-day government business goes on. There are projects in his riding. I believe there is a bridge going on. I hear there is a health centre being built right now. So there are projects that go on besides the extra things that we have identified as our priorities, besides the extra things that we decide as our mandate. If we did not even have priorities or a mandate, this government would still provide services to the residents of the Northwest Territories.

It probably is something that he should give notice of so that we can compile that information.

I need help in regard to keeping our elders home, because we want to take care of our own elders. We don't need them just shipped off to Inuvik, where my people, the people who I represent, can't go see their loved ones. The only time they are going to go see them is if they are on medical or somewhere, because cost of travel is too high, and then when they bring them home for a funeral. That is the problem. I need help in regard to getting a long-term facility in Ulukhaktok, so would the Premier commit to that instead of putting 48 beds, which we already have 25 in Inuvik, taking elders out of our community?

I am not going to stand here and commit that I will have a long-term facility in every single community. I would love to see that, again, just as I would love to have a house for every person. In honesty, I would probably put the house first: Maslow's hierarchy; food, clothing, and shelter. Our seniors are important. Our elders are important. We recognize that. We have a shortage of health professionals; we know that. We need to look at a recruitment program; we know that.

What I can say is that this government is committed to looking at whatever policies we can do, that we can change, so that we can make it better for elders to stay in our homes. Because we do know that the most humane thing that we can do for our elders is to keep them close to their families and their friends as long as possible, but there are situations, times, when elders have to be shipped from homes because the care is not there in the communities. 
2020-05-13 10:16:21,683 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — Again, I wish we could do better, but at this point, in this economy, I think that we have to be realistic and honest and say that we don't have the staffing, and we don't have the funding at this time, so we are willing to look at whatever we can do in the meantime.

We have a need in our smaller communities, such as Paulatuk, Tuktoyaktuk, and Ulukhaktok. Ulukhaktok is a priority. I have elders sitting in a long-term care facility who are not seeing family, and it is hard on them. Too much hardship going on, all the time.

2020-05-13 10:16:23,335 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — The recent projects undertaken at the Fort Smith airport, the installation of LED lighting and the rightsizing of the runway, were undertaken when the standards and regulations were set by Transport Canada and were designed and completed to industry and professional standards. 
2020-05-13 10:16:23,346 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — I would like to assure the Member that neither the safety nor the level of service at the Fort Smith airport has changed as a result of these projects.

2020-05-13 10:16:23,349 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. KATRINA NOKLEBY: The decision to replace the airside lighting and to narrow the runway at the Fort Smith airport was made based on current and future operational and regulatory needs. As part of ongoing airport planning, it was determined that the aging lighting system needed to be replaced. It was also determined that a 30-metre runway would meet federal regulations and would not affect the level of service at the Fort Smith airport. Because the lighting replacement project would require digging up sections of the runway, it made good sense to complete both projects at the same time.

2020-05-13 10:16:23,350 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — When the Fort Smith airport was designed and built in 1957, 60 metres was a common width for paved runways. It was predicted at the time that future aircraft would be bigger and larger runways would be required. That is, in fact, not the case. Modern aircraft have improved performance, and the federal regulator has established that wider runways are not necessary. The cost to operate and maintain a 30-metre runway is significantly less than to operate and maintain a 60-metre runway. The cost to repair or overlay a 30-metre runway will also be less. 
2020-05-13 10:16:23,351 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — I would like to assure the Member that the decision to proceed with these projects was made with the safety of citizens in the front of our minds. The decision was also based on operational needs, minimizing costs to the Government of the Northwest Territories and to taxpayers, and ensuring ongoing eligibility for federal funding for future capital projects at the Fort Smith airport.

Is the Minister willing to work with me to do a pilot project in the Beaufort-Delta to provide service for all nine communities in the region, to prevent cancer?

I am asking the Minister today to commit, just say yes with me, on a pilot project for the Beaufort-Delta to establish a team of professionals who will travel into the communities to do pre-screening for our elders and for the people who can't leave the community, who only go to the nursing station when they are really sick. They feel like they are not going to waste people's time, because, you know, they're not feeling well. They have to be really sick to go to the health centre. You know that, Mr. Speaker. All I am asking is if we could do a pilot project for one year, and then see how many people's lives we could save, the people who we serve. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

It is an issue that I have personally been engaged on for many years, and I can't imagine that anyone who knew me in my past life would expect me to come into this House and not see this as a personal priority. With that, Mr. Speaker, I would certainly like to assure that, doing my part, as Minister of Justice, and the Department of Justice of the Northwest Territories, we will be considering that a priority over the next four years.

The newspaper, the media, everybody has said this is a changed government, and I have to put it back and say that the last government also was supposed to be a changed government, but I didn't feel that the people felt that it was changed enough, so they spoke out very loudly and said, "We're going to try it again. We're changing up our government."

2020-05-13 10:16:23,503 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — We made a commitment. There is something wrong with politicians; if we were all doing a great job, the same Members would still be here. I am not saying that any of the colleagues didn't do a great job. I respect them all, but the people weren't satisfied, and so we weren't doing a good job. I think, a lot of times, the government has been pretty guarded in what we have done. We have taken a view sometimes, in my personal opinion, that says that we should know best, and if we don't know best, we look weak. I have to say that I am a mom, I am a social worker, I am a woman. I don't know if that makes a difference, but I believe it does. I don't see the lack of knowing answers as a weakness, and I don't see it as something that is a barrier. I see it as a strength, when you're willing to put it out there. 
2020-05-13 10:16:23,513 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — Already you see that this Cabinet has tried to work more closely with MLAs. We have shared information that has never been shared before. I hear the frustration of MLAs when we try to move in that way, saying, "You're taking too much. You're sharing too much. Get some work done." It is about finding that fine balance, is what I am struggling with. How much do we work together and build that trust, that relationship, and yet how much do we hold and get the work done? I know that some Members have said we have been here six months and nothing has happened. Other Members are saying we have been here six months and we have seen incredible things happen, with the change in how we are working across the floor. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

One of the Members talked about suicide today. A lot of times, if we are not careful in how we treat people, that is a risk that we take. I am not willing to take that risk; I would rather, as a leader, be told that I'm not open when it comes to talking about personal issues of people. I will talk generally about issues of people, though, and that is how we will try to work.

In fairness to all of us here, sometimes our plates are so busy that the easy answer is just to reappoint the person who has been there before, because it's easy. They're already there; we have already gone through the vetting; we know who they are. Is that the best way to appoint boards? That is what I have been challenging my Cabinet with.

We will actually be looking at terms of boards, because there is a benefit to having corporate knowledge, a person who has the knowledge, but there is a real benefit to having new blood. We see that here in this Assembly, a younger and new voice, and I think that we have an obligation to make sure, in all of our boards, that we have an equal balance of people who have the knowledge and people who have great new ideas coming forward. It is a discussion that we are on, and you will see a change within our policies within this term.

The situation for CSFTNO is different, as I mentioned in my statement, in that its commissaires represent two communities that now have different cycles for their municipal elections. To me, it sounds like the best solution here may be to allow education authorities to set their own terms of office, with approval of the Minister, of course. I am sure that the Minister is aware of this complication, but I am wondering whether his department has contemplated a solution for the term of office issue for CSFTNO.

2020-05-13 10:16:23,602 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — On Tuesday, after the media release was issued, I received an email sent on behalf of Dr. Tom Weegar that stated, "After much contemplation and soul-searching, I decided to step away from post-secondary education leadership for the time being," which led me to believe that he was stepping away from post-secondary leadership education for the time being, voluntarily. That is why I made the statements that I did.

2020-05-13 10:16:25,319 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. O'REILLY: Merci, Monsieur le President. In my statement earlier today, I noted that the publicly available end-of-life obligations for the Cameron Hills field as prepared by the court-appointed monitor appears to be over $12 million. The actual figure is probably much higher, and that leaves a significant shortfall from the $3 million held as financial security. My questions are for the Minister of Lands. Can the Minister explain how our government failed to ensure that financial security held for Cameron Hills does not at least equal the liabilities, and who will make up the difference? Mahsi, Mr. Speaker.

2020-05-13 10:16:25,331 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. SHANE THOMPSON: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Strategic Oil and Gas was, at the time of devolution, transferred an operations site which has gone through an environmental screening and regulatory process and met the criteria for a release site. The site has an owner that is responsible for clean-up and environmental liabilities. Canada transferred the securities associated with all operating sites on April 1st, 2014. Adequacy of security is the subject of continual review and revision as part of the modern regulatory process in the NWT.

2020-05-13 10:16:25,332 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — At the moment, Strategic Oil and Gas, although it is in creditor protection as it attempts to restructure its operation, is still responsible for remediation obligations related to its sites in the NWT. Under our current system, there are a number of authorities that address securities, including the independent Mackenzie Valley Land and Water Board. Security is required as part of the land tender authorization, and, in the case of oil and gas, operation securities operate to address operations and safety. I believe that the Member will agree with me that there is room for improvement to better ensure that the environmental liabilities are borne by the developer who is responsible for creating them and that adequate securities are put in place to address them when operators become insolvent and unable to continue their operations.
2020-05-13 10:16:25,332 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. O'REILLY: I want to thank the Minister for that detailed information. It didn't really still answer the question of how this happened under our watch. More than five years after devolution, it appears our government still doesn't have an early-warning system on operations like Strategic Oil and Gas, that place taxpayers at significant financial risk. The commitment to develop a financial security system to prevent public liabilities remains unfulfilled from the 18th Assembly. As GNWT is a big promoter of oil and gas development, can the Minister tell us what the plans are to prevent future public liabilities from these activities?

2020-05-13 10:16:25,333 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. SHANE THOMPSON: The Department of Lands, and Environment and Natural Resources prepared security estimates to cover environmental liabilities for new projects as well as existing operations. The process to review and amend securities is directed by the regional land and water boards, which have the legislative responsibility to set the securities amount in water licences and land use permits. If there is change to the project or authorization, a new security review process is initiated by the regulatory boards. Making sure that the right balance between protecting the environment and allowing for investment is a challenge for all jurisdictions. I think it is fair to say that this is a particular challenge when we see industry like oil and gas struggle. While we will not always be able to anticipate when operations will run into difficulties meeting their obligations, efforts are made to review existing securities, to mitigate the risk associated with this development. This is something that I can say I believe we can work on as a government and improve.

2020-05-13 10:16:25,334 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. O'REILLY: I want to thank the Minister for that. This is something I have been working on for most of my adult life here in the Northwest Territories, over 30 years, so I look forward to working with this Minister to try to get this where it needs to be. Strategic Oil and Gas, in preparing its conceptual closure and reclamation plan, relied on something called "Guidelines for Closure and Reclamation of Advanced Mineral Exploration and Mine Sites in the Northwest Territories." More than five years after devolution, our government does not appear to have put in place a coherent policy and regulatory framework for closure and reclamation of oil and gas. Can the Minister tell me, Mr. Speaker, when we are going to have a robust framework for closure and reclamation of oil and gas development in the Northwest Territories?

2020-05-13 10:16:25,335 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. SHANE THOMPSON: The "Guidelines for Closure and Reclamation of Advanced Mineral Exploration and Mine Sites in the Northwest Territories" were developed jointly by the land and water boards of the Mackenzie Valley and the Government of Canada, now CIRNAC. These guidelines outline the requirement for closure and reclamation plans and stress that closure objectives and criteria be established for the site. Although these guidelines are designed to cover mineral explorations and mine closure, the concept of guidelines apply to all development projects in the NWT. These guidelines were used to guide development of the closure and reclamation plan for the Imperial Oil production facility in Norman Wells and have been used to guide the development of the revised closure and reclamation plan for the Cameron Hills facility. This was submitted to the Mackenzie Valley Land and Water Board in August 2019. Given the predominance of mining in the resource-extraction sector of the NWT, it is understandable that the early focus of the work between the Board and Canada was focused on mining. I believe we can continue to work on this with the board and Canada to provide more direct guidance related to oil and gas.

We have had devolution now for five years, and we don't have a proper, robust regulatory framework for closure and reclamation in place, five years, Mr. Speaker. It is my view that the government doesn't really have a great track record in managing resources in the post-devolution world. In an unprecedented move, the Minister turned back a decision on a water licence amendment, following a request from a diamond mining company. Then unilateral changes were made to measures arising from an environmental assessment of the Tlicho All-Season Road. Financial security gaps still exist for the Prairie Creek mine and now for Cameron Hills. Can the Minister tell the House whether there has been a systematic review of all operations for which we are now responsible, to ensure that we have full financial security in place, and, if not, when is this going to happen?

2020-05-13 10:16:25,351 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — The GNWT conducts a review of reclamation securities when there is a new licence, a licence amendment, a revision of the closure and reclamation plans, or a change to the project that would result in changes to the environment securities. These reviews are meant to ensure that the liability associated with these projects are covered in the securities held by the GNWT. I think it is fair to acknowledge that the current system might be improved and that a more comprehensive review is something that should be considered in the future. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

Operating the sobering and day centre is not without challenges, and the Northwest Territories Health and Social Services authority and the operator of the centre are working hard to make sure these changes to ensure programming is meeting the needs of the clients who are homeless and not receiving services from any other service providers. I would like to let the Member know that the day centre and sobering centre have been allowing people to come in and warm up during this cold snap. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

When you come in and you say, you know, that the operator will ask if you have, if you are homeless or if you are here for what type of service, and if you self-declare that you are homeless, then you will be provided, and you will be allowed in the centre.

As the Member is aware, demands on the public purse are high, and we want to make sure that we are fully considering these types of decisions.

Our plan will mean greater returns for fishers working on the lake. It will mean new jobs in processing, packaging, selling, and transporting NWT fish for market. When it comes to the plant, however, I will be fully transparent. The answer is no, we don't have a new timeline yet, but we will get one, and I will share that with you. While we consider next steps for the plant, we are also moving ahead with other elements of the overall revitalization strategy. We will be establishing a fisheries support officer to work out of Hay River. We are working with Memorial University to develop training programs around fish handling, processing, and filleting. We have partnered with the marine training centre to deliver relevant training for fishers. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

I would like to go into the community and take a look at what we actually have there, what is our inventory for Behchoko. I am really looking at the safety, as well, too, and looking at the options that we might be able to provide as NWT Housing Corporation in regards to insurances. I will look at options going forward.

A lot of them are homeless now. These are families that are desperately in need of help, and those pleas have been ignored for a very long time by this housing corporation.

As it stands, they are homeless right now, couch-surfing in the community. They do not have a warm place to go to at times, so what is the current position of the Housing Corporation to deal with these burnt units so we can have the family go back to their community homes?

Also, for the burnt units, once again, we will explore options for the home insurances.

It's a timely question in that we have just completed a home and community care review for the Northwest Territories. We received the full final report on September 16th, which includes 22 recommendations. These recommendations are currently being prioritized by the staff; however, I can tell you that we also included research from other jurisdictions. The information in the review supports that, by investing in home and community care, there is potential to divert some costs related to long-term care. This is a priority for the department and, drawing from the experience in other jurisdictions, we are continuing to assess what this may mean for the Northwest Territories.

When the home and community care review was conducted, one of the purposes of the review was to look at the consistency in how services are delivered across the Northwest Territories, as well as if there are any gaps in the program and services. There are recommendations from the review that do speak to exploring the feasibility of expanding hours of services. We will be working with the health and social services authorities to determine how we can move this recommendation forward, including which communities will be our priority based on current needs.

It's never our goal to have someone leave their home or community; however, we all know that there are times when the care may become so complex that we need to consider other options for care for our clients. We have a number of residents who have had to relocate outside the Northwest Territories to receive care that has exceeded our ability to provide.

It allows an opportunity to due diligence on the materials that are presented in support of an invoice, in addition to which the goal in fact is to pay BIP members or BIP businesses within 20 days, a standard that we are working towards. So that is the rationale, Mr. Speaker. Thank you.

All of those things can help improve the system, and we will be taking those steps to improve the process.

The communication between the department and the education bodies, the boards themselves and the regional councils, needs to be improved. I have spoken at length with the department about this, and I have reached out to all the education chairs around the territory. I haven't been able to get a hold of one, but I have spoken with all the other ones to bridge that gap and ensure that we have better communication. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

2020-05-13 10:16:27,351 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — Education is a tough department, and I know some of the Ministers have had a rough go at it over the past little while, whether it is junior kindergarten or whatever it may be. We are actually in a good place right now because the department has learned from a lot of the issues that have come out in the last few years and has done really well with gathering data and really focusing themselves. Going forward, we are going to be delivering more focused programming that hopefully will deliver results.
2020-05-13 10:16:27,352 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — In terms of going to every community, I will be travelling to a lot of the communities.

2020-05-13 10:16:27,353 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. BONNETROUGE: Mahsi to the Minister for his answers. Most if not all the small communities are quite possibly facing more teacher layoffs in the near future. My community of Fort Providence has lost four teacher positions this past June. This is creating increasing workloads for the existing teachers as they are teaching more than one grade and quite possibly increasing the stress levels for the teachers. Shouldn't a situation like this raise red flags in the education system, and what is the GNWT Department of ECE going to do about these situations in the small, outlying communities?

Then once the regional education body receives that funding, it allocates it to individual schools. It is the principals of those schools who determine how that funding is best used. When there are declining enrollments, that means there is less money. That means there are fewer teachers.

Now, I don't want to get into the specifics of the process that we are engaged in in terms of developing a mandate, but I think it is pretty clear that those priorities don't provide sufficient direction to all of the Ministers. I am just wondering: can the Premier tell us how the initial direction will be set for each Minister to cover matters outside of the priorities?

It is meant to define what the major issues are that we want to tackle. It does not give clear direction for every single department, nor is it meant to, in my understanding. I am only one Member of the Legislative Assembly, though, so I am open to feedback on that.

I guess what I am most worried about is where the initial direction is going to come from for each of the Ministers and the departments. Yesterday, the Premier suggested to the Member for Yellowknife Centre that people could go and walk into her office and talk to her about priorities. That's not a very efficient or effective way of doing this. It doesn't recognize the role that standing committees should play in terms of consensus government, so I have suggested privately and publicly that the Premier be prepared to share the draft mandate letters with each of the standing committees. Is that something that the Premier is prepared to do in the spirit of open, transparent, and consensus-style government?

It is a direction that I have given my Ministers. However, I have also heard from MLAs across the table in different areas, "Let's get to work. Let's get it done." My Ministers are also waiting. They have been waiting months to get their mandate letters. We're still in the process. Everybody is just anxious to get them, so I want to get these off. I want to get to work.

2020-05-13 10:16:27,434 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — The Member is right. Small communities have lower graduation rates. They have lower attendance rates. One of the priorities of this Assembly is to increase student education outcomes to the rest of Canada. In some regional centres and in Yellowknife, the student outcomes are nearly the same as the rest of Canada, so it really is the small communities, in a lot of ways, that we are talking about. 
2020-05-13 10:16:27,435 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — There are things that are being done by the school boards. It is the school boards that have the mandate to deliver education. There are things like Healthy Food for Learning so that there is food in the schools, so that children, once they get there, they can actually eat, and they can learn. Some schools have programs where homes are called when students are missing. They go out looking for the children. Some schools offer incentives or prizes for attendance. However, there is more than that that needs to be done. I think we need buy-in from communities, we need buy-in from parents, and we need to start caring more about education as a society. That is one of the things that I really want to do, is get the word out there and get people involved in their own education. 
2020-05-13 10:16:27,436 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — There are a number of things that we are doing through the education renewal, as well. Like I mentioned before, there are a lot of these old small programs that we are trying to tailor, but more needs to be done. The Member is absolutely right; more needs to be done. If you look at graduation rates, they are declining across the board, and so we have to do more. I am committed to working with the Member and hearing from all of the Members, especially from small communities, about how we can do that. 
2020-05-13 10:16:27,436 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. NORN: I would like to thank the Minister for his response. I think it is important, too, that visibility for your department is important in my riding. There are four schools in my riding. The one in Ndilo and one in Detah, those are easy places to do a tour. That would be really good. I would like to see that, but, if I could get a commitment from the Minister to see if he could visit our schools in Lutselk'e and Deninu Kue, I think it is important. It helps boost morale for the teachers and the kids, and I think it is important that they see the head of our education department.

I'm going to see what I can do this Assembly. Fort Resolution is right near Hay River, so that will be an easy one. My new deputy minister, who I am lucky to have, is a former principal. One of the first things she did is told me about what a big impression it makes on students when the Minister comes to their school and engages them, and it got me excited about it. I look forward to it. I look forward to getting to some of the places where I don't normally get to go, places like Lutselk'e. I can't make any commitments about timelines, but I am going to do my best to visit as many schools as I can.

That was more, I think, in terms of evaluating the success of the program as a whole as opposed to the individual success. I am sure the Member will appreciate, and, as he has already alluded to in his opening, the individual successes on a program like this will depend a lot on how exactly one measures not only recidivism but obviously the reducing of severity of violence and the frequency of violence, so it is a very complex thing to measure, and the success of one individual may differ from the success of another.

For what it is worth to the Member, one of the newest places where that program is being offered is at the North Slave Correctional facility, and it does therefore target individuals who come from across communities all across the Northwest Territories. That said, obviously, it is quite different from being offered within the communities themselves. 
2020-05-13 10:16:27,472 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — I can say also that the justice department, through Community Justice, is providing community-led and community-originated programs, both in Tsiigehtchic and in Fort Good Hope, and there continue to be opportunities to engage with community justice programs in order to help develop those programs in those communities. I look forward to having discussions in order to expand that, where possible. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

I am sure the new Minister is aware that schools in Yellowknife are aging and maintenance costs are increasing.

Unlike most jurisdictions in the Northwest Territories, most communities, the school infrastructure of YK1 is owned by YK1, for the most part. As such, it is not the GNWT that provides maintenance; it is actually YK1. The GNWT does provide a maintenance budget. I believe it is $1.4 million annually to YK1 to perform this type of maintenance.

Regulations are being drafted to bring these acts into force March 31, 2020. The regulations are almost done; however, time is needed to communicate the new requirements to retailers to the public.

The regulations being developed to bring the acts into force do not go so far as completely banning flavoured vaping products in the Northwest Territories at this time. We are actively working to identify the right approach to banning flavoured vaping products. Our public health officials are talking with the Council of Chief Medical Officers of Health to support a federal ban on flavoured vaping products. Chief Medical Officers of Health across Canada are now calling on the federal government to ban flavoured vaping products outright. Before moving forward, the Northwest Territories regulations banning all sales on flavoured vaping products would want to engage with the public. We also want to carry out more research to make sure we have everything properly addressed.

Sorry, I'm going to have to go a little bit off-script here, because I think I heard the Minister say that the Tobacco and Vapour Products Control Act is not going to prohibit flavoured vaping products from being sold. Section 6.1(1) says that: "No person shall sell a flavoured tobacco product at retail." In any event, does this section actually prohibit the sale of flavoured vaping products, or not? Is that what this act and this section are going to do?

It was certainly my understanding, having sat in on the committee meetings, that that was the intention of the committee, and I thought that's what the bill was going to do. In any event, recent media reports about the use of vaping products in southern Canada and the US describe an epidemic in use by youth, and that manufacturers and retailers have specifically designed advertising to entice youth. I've had this raised to me by teachers at schools in my riding. Can the Minister tell us whether her department has taken any steps to control or persuade NWT youth not to consume these products?

In October 2019, the department created a Frequently Asked Questions for parents. The Department of Education, Culture and Employment distributed this to schools across the Northwest Territories. This work began with the request from a school principal and is an example of how working together with our partners can be valuable in addressing an issue, just like when some of the other Regular MLAs in the Assembly worked with the last Assembly on the bills themselves. The Office of the Chief Public Officer is preparing communications and social marketing material.

2020-05-13 10:16:29,165 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. JACOBSON: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today, I am really concerned with our airline services that we're having back home in the Delta. Since this merger came online with Canadian North and First Air, our cancer patients and medical travel patients have been having a really tough time getting out of Inuvik. Today, seeing as a community I represent, Paulatuk, is having five people on standby, I am calling out the airline, Mr. Speaker, in regard to getting aircraft and adequate services provided to these people who are travelling for cancer, cancer patients for either surgery or treatment, and any others, because everything is done in the south and we have two days' travel just to get to where we're trying to go.

Medical travel is a live issue and we are working to mitigate the impact on medical travelers. We are working with Stanton Clinic to ensure that there is sufficient time to process travel requests to make the specialist appointments in time, checking with airlines to see if travel is available for the required day, and booking a day earlier, if needed.

There are unrealistic expectations that people travelling on medical travel can somehow bump other paying passengers on an over-subscribed flight.

2020-05-13 10:16:29,180 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. JACOBSON: It's pretty dire, I guess, in regards to when you're travelling. When we travel down here, since the last two months we've been here, I've been travelling on that 14 times. Every time, you're seeing somebody in the airport actually being physically taken off the flight, being removed. I'm asking the Minister: would she call a meeting, I guess, with all the transportation providers that provide service to this government, to call them in and try to work with them to try to get adequate aircraft and try to get our patients out of our ridings to where they are travelling for their appointments?

2020-05-13 10:16:29,185 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. O'REILLY: Merci, Monsieur le President. The last Assembly passed legislation for a Northwest Territories Carbon Tax. Despite detailed questions, the regulations to implement the Carbon Tax were not shared with Regular Members, but came into force on August 29, 2019. I have a number of questions for the new Minister of Finance on the implementation of the NWT Carbon Tax. Can the Minister explain how, if, and when guidelines will be established for the approval and payment of emission reductions grants to large emitters, and will these be shared with standing committee in draft form?

As they are going through that process, I can assure the Member that, indeed, draft guidelines will be shared with the committees for review. While I don't have a deadline for that, I am expecting that that should be in early 2020 and, at that time, I would be happy to join in terms of making myself available, as well, to the Member in order to participate in the review of those draft guidelines.

For the record, the large emitters in the Northwest Territories, as set out in the regulations, are Diavik Diamond Mines (2012) Incorporated; De Beers Canada, Incorporated; Dominion Diamond Ekati Corporation; and Imperial Oil Resources NWT Limited. Could the Minister tell us whether there have been any discussions between large emitters and Finance officials on the Carbon Tax and its implementation, and would the Minister provide this Assembly with some details?

2020-05-13 10:16:29,188 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. CAROLINE WAWZONEK: I can say that there have been some discussions on some level, certainly before the Carbon Tax became law and mostly with regard to the structure of the Carbon Tax regime itself, not necessarily with the implementation of the program or of the draft guidelines, so I'm not sure that the discussions that were had are necessarily going to the substance of the matter that is at issue presently. If there have been any further discussions more recently, I would certainly endeavour to inquire about that, but to date my information is that the discussions were prior to the implementation.

These included, of course, both in-person and online consultations. The Annual Report on the Northwest Territories Carbon Tax will be tabled annually in the Legislative Assembly. That certainly does provide the Members of this Assembly with the opportunity to review the implementation and to inquire as to that implementation. In addition, the Northwest Territories Climate Change Strategic Framework itself also commits to an annual emissions tracking system and reporting, which is to be done in collaboration with Environment and Climate Change Canada. I would expect that that item will also be coming before the Assembly in due course, Mr. Speaker, and provide the Assembly with the opportunity to ask questions of it.

She talked about annual reporting, which is great, and that's what I want to get to next. One of the reasons I voted against the Carbon Tax last Assembly was the total absence of accountability and transparency in implementing the legislation and the inability of Regular MLAs to propose any meaningful changes. The regulations that were quietly introduced on August 29, 2019, do not set out or require any form of public reporting on significant matters such as how much carbon tax is collected, what it's used for, and whether it's actually effective or not. Can the Minister explain to this House what public reporting will be undertaken on the collection, use, and effectiveness of the Carbon Tax and, if not, why not? Thanks, Mr. Speaker.

2020-05-13 10:16:29,222 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — The Member brings up a good point: are we keeping track of who is educated? If we don't know, how do we bring them back here? We do know what programs our residents are taking, if they are receiving SFA. We know what institutions they are attending. Outside of that, we don't have that ability. If someone just goes off to school, there is no way of knowing. However, we do try to attract our students back, as well, with our SFA. We have great loan repayment incentives, zero percent interest on loans and increased remission rates, and a northern bonus, as well. So, while we're not where I think the Member would like us to be, we're getting there. It's somewhere that I want to get to because, when I was on that side, I was asking the same question. People are going out and getting educated; 80 percent of the jobs, almost, by 2030 are going to need a post-secondary education, so how do we get those residents? This is something I'm working on, I'm committed to working on, and I look forward to working with the Member on this.

2020-05-13 10:16:29,224 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — What kind of statistics does the department have on the success of our northern Indigenous students at post-secondary? The reason I'm asking that is we need to somehow track these students so we can attract them back to the Northwest Territories. It's something that has been a real challenge over the years, and I believe that this is an area that we need to tackle as a department. 
2020-05-13 10:16:29,225 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. R.J. SIMPSON: I don't have those numbers at my fingertips. I can say that Aurora College, however, has recently implemented a new student information system that can track that type of information, and finally in the North we have that capability. It was a long time that we weren't able to do that at the college, and so, in the last two years, we've achieved that. The department has actually come a long way in terms of the statistics that it collects and the information that it has to analyze, and so I think that we're moving in that direction. Unfortunately, I don't have those numbers on me right now. My department might not like me making work for them, but I commit to getting that information for the Member.

Mr. Speaker, [translation] when students go to college, we want everything readily available for them and we also want them to return to work in our communities, so how many of them are in college? I am asking the Minister of Education. [Translation ends] I am going to reach out to the post-secondary students to provide them opportunities, such as jobs, internships, on-the-job training, and most especially in the small isolated communities that my colleagues over the years have demanded, even in, still, the small communities, create opportunities for these students to return to their home communities for their education, so what have we done as a department to date on this particular area?

2020-05-13 10:16:29,238 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — One of the first things I talked about when I got this portfolio was the need to be better communicators and do a better job promoting education and promoting the North as a place to come back to. We need to reach out to our students. We do that through Student Financial Assistance. They have a great advertising program. When I was in school, I always knew when my payments were supposed to come and when my application was supposed to be in, and we need to extend that. We need to let people know our students who are away know that there is work for them back here. The Northwest Territories is still the land of opportunity. You know, that is why I came back. I have said in this House many times that, when I was in law school, that would have been an opportune time for the GNWT to reach out to me and talk about some of the opportunities that there are in the North. That is one thing I am working on, and I look forward to making that happen.

He may not have the stats today, but I would like to get that information from him: how many students did we hire last summer in their fields of studies, either graduates or in existing programs? That information will be valuable for the Members across the floor here to work with a Minister at the appropriate time. 
2020-05-13 10:16:29,240 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. R.J. SIMPSON: I believe we hired around 300 summer students in the GNWT, but I am not sure how many are in their actual field of study. I think the Department of Justice hired all the law students from the Northwest Territories last year, actually, though. You know, we are making some progress, and I look forward to making more, but, you know, these are all good points, and I will continue to advance this. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

I believe there are 40 jobs in corporate services. There has never been a plan to move that out of Fort Smith. There is not a plan now to move it out of Fort Smith. There has never even been a discussion about moving that out of Fort Smith, so I want to give the Member that assurance. 
2020-05-13 10:16:29,269 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — In terms of the engagement she talked about, one of the first things I did, again in the first meeting I had with the Aurora College transition team, was talk about the level of engagement that we have. I said that, if you want to be successful in this transition, the staff has to buy in at Aurora College, you know, the staff in Fort Smith. I made that point very clear, and so, going forward, we are on the verge of creating some working groups within the College, so that a staff will be fully engaged in developing and implementing plans going forward. There is going to be a three-year strategic plan that Aurora College is developing. 
2020-05-13 10:16:29,270 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — Right now, there is an online survey that any member of the public can fill out, and that is open until January, I believe, 10 of 2020.

2020-05-13 10:16:29,271 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — The other thing I said in my first meeting was that, you know, this Assembly committed to implementing the United Nations' declaration on the rights of Indigenous People, and I am not going to get ahead of ourselves in the mandate, but it is clear that we need to have more engagement with Indigenous governments. I wanted to make sure, and I told my department that we need to have the right kind of engagement with Indigenous governments. The department is going to reach out to the Indigenous governments and define what that engagement is going to look like, and that includes Salt River, and that includes the Metis in Fort Smith.

These aren't just regular program reviews like the college would normally do. These are academic program reviews that are part of a new framework that are up to national standards. They are, let's see, the Ministerial Statement on Quality Assurance of Degree Education in Canada, released by the Council of Ministers of Education, is what we are conforming to. The college, as it was, has been around for 50 years. It should have been, you know, the jewel of the North in terms of education but for a number of reasons, the academic standards and the quality were allowed to slip.

They kept me focused on the needs, but they did not limit me. I must make that clear. They did not limit me in what my powers were. They gave me a guideline. They said, "You must do these," but I also appreciate that I had the freedom to move the departments as I felt was appropriate, based on the needs of people.

They can send them to me. They can walk into my office. I will not commit that I will meet every one of them because that is a decision that has to be made, but I am open to hearing their feedback. In fact, I am soliciting their feedback, is what I am doing at this point. 
2020-05-13 10:16:29,342 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — There are also other chances for Regular Members to have feedback. The mandate letters is one area. The mandate process that we are going through is one area, but we also have main estimates that will be coming up, capital budgets, business plans. During that process, Cabinet Members will be providing to standing committees their projections, their wishes, and standing committee will have time in that to actually give feedback to Ministers, as well, and then, of course, challenging on the floor and Committee of the Whole.

2020-05-13 10:16:29,356 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MS. CLEVELAND: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. My question today is for the Minister of Finance. Mr. Speaker, for many years, we have discussed the modernization of the Public Service Act. With over 5,000 public servants providing essential programs and services to nearly 45,000 Northerners, it is our responsibility to ensure our public service is competent, efficient, skilled, results-oriented, managed in a transparent manner, and supported to maximize their effectiveness.

2020-05-13 10:16:29,357 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — A modern Public Service Act would allow us to provide clearer staffing processes, build a framework for successful union-employer relations, strengthen and celebrate teamwork, and implement a fair process for the safe disclosure of wrongdoing. Mr. Speaker, can the Minister confirm that the Government of the Northwest Territories intends to update the Public Service Act during this Assembly? Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

I am pleased to have this question from the Member. The need to modernize the Public Service Act is really overwhelming, the last substantive review, of course, being back in 1988.

2020-05-13 10:16:29,369 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — With that, I am pleased to be able to say that it is my intention to bring a bill forward to amend the Public Service Act early in 2020. A significant amount of work was actually already completed on this during the previous Assembly, back in 2017. I have already been briefed on that work, and I have already requested that the department work without delay to bring this matter to a point where we can have it dealt with within the current Assembly. 
2020-05-13 10:16:29,370 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — We are conducting some final pieces of consultation with some of the key stakeholders who played a role in that initial work from two years ago, and it is again my intention to have a legislative proposal to standing committee for consideration in the February 2020 session. After reviewing and responding to any questions standing committee may have, of course, the bill would then be drafted for Cabinet approval, with my hope that it will be introduced in the Legislative Assembly in due course. 
2020-05-13 10:16:29,371 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MS. CLEVELAND: As part of the legislative review process, what public bodies will the GNWT engage as they modernize the Public Service Act? How will constructive participation be assured? Thank you.

2020-05-13 10:16:29,372 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. CAROLINE WAWZONEK: Again, I appreciate the question in that ensuring that we engage the stakeholders, in particular the unions, Union of Norther Workers and the Northwest Territories Teachers' Association, is critical. Both of those organizations, as key stakeholders, were significantly involved two years ago, during the initial consultations, and it is critical that they be involved again before this matter can actually progress in any real way. Again, making sure that they are involved and that the relationship with those unions is renewed between the government and the unions is of critical importance to me and to this government. It is important that we strengthen that relationship.

2020-05-13 10:16:29,373 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — I am pleased to say that both the UNW and the Northwest Territories Teachers' Association have been provided already with reading materials about our intention to proceed with proposed updates to the Public Service Act and that their feedback will be taken into consideration, of course, as we progress to have amendments done on this act. Currently, the Department of Finance is doing that engagement, and that kind of engagement is what will make this a success, ultimately.
2020-05-13 10:16:29,374 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — Another critical stakeholder, Mr. Speaker, is, of course, the public servants. Department of Finance, back in 2017, held focus groups in person in Fort Smith, in Inuvik, and in Yellowknife, with the assistance of a facilitator, as well as collecting feedback broadly online and through other forums. The public employees were also encouraged to provide that feedback anonymously in the online tool.
2020-05-13 10:16:29,375 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — I would also note that we are conscious that the Northwest Territories Power Corporation also needs to be engaged and have their feedback taken into account as they were in 2017 and as they would need to be in the renewal of that process.
2020-05-13 10:16:29,376 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — All of the employees, the unions, and the general public, of course, will have an opportunity to be engaged throughout any consultation progress that would be led by the standing committee as this matter proceeds, again, hopefully, in early 2020. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

During an ENR presentation last month to the Priorities and Planning Committee, there was mention of a caribou management plan. What was amiss was the Bison Management Plan. I would like to recognize that the community of Fort Providence is on the doorstep to the Mackenzie Bison Sanctuary. My question to the ENR Minister is: I am interested to know if there is an updated Bison Management Plan and if the community of Fort Providence is aware of such. Mahsi.

Mackenzie Bison Management Plan was finalized in 2018 to provide guidance on the management of the herd. The plan was developed collaboratively by the Mackenzie Bison Working Group, which included representatives from GNWT, Indigenous governments, and other key stakeholders.

2020-05-13 10:16:29,404 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — In regards to community of Fort Providence, I have similar issues in Fort Liard and Nahanni Butte. Bison are known to come into the communities of Fort Providence and cause conflict in the community along the highway. ENR works collaboratively with the communities to respond to bison in a number of ways, taking steps to avoid attracting bison into the community, highway, and airstrip; herding bison out of the community if they come in and are causing injuries; and ultimately removing persistent bison that cannot be herded out of town. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
2020-05-13 10:16:29,405 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. BONNETROUGE: It is kind of ironic that I chose this topic today as I went into the local restaurant here and they were serving bison stew. I had myself a hearty bowl of bison stew. I guess what I am trying to get at is that we really miss having that stuff as part of a food staple in our community. The residents of Fort Providence had previously been issued bison tags to harvest bison for food. Since the anthrax outbreaks a while back, all that has ceased. I am just wondering: what is the update on the issuance of bison tags to the community of Fort Providence?

ENR has received a request from the First Nations and the Metis Council for a permit to harvest four and two bison, respectively. We are working with Indigenous governments right now to see how we can help them.

We had committed to being part of the national action plan that would be done by the federal government, of course waiting if they got elected again, which they have been. We did a high-level review of the report, and we identified not specific questions, but more of a thematic kind of approach to the inquiry itself, to the release of the report. That was tabled in the House in August last year. 
2020-05-13 10:16:29,436 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — My commitment is carrying it forward. We do have a new federal government.

This government commits to moving forward with this file, to doing whatever we can within our power to address the issue of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls and, of course, the needs of the LGBTQ2S population.

Very happily, I am now the Premier of this 19th Legislative Assembly, so we will definitely be picking up the work. We will be reinstating the interdepartmental working group to look at every recommendation in the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls report that was filed.

Going forward, I look forward to working and reviewing this document and using it within the next four years. I also reflect on the past government. They had the initiative, and they went to all 32 communities in the Northwest Territories to collaborate that information, to work with those programs and services to develop a new strategy for the next government.

My last question is: I would like to ask for some stats on the number of applications and the number of denials in terms of program requests, housing program requests, by community. Mahsi cho.

2020-05-13 10:16:29,491 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. JOHNSON: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I wanted to make my first questions today to the Minister of Health and Social Services on child and family services. What has happened in the past is we have had a number of audits from the Auditor General which were scathing of the treatment of children in care. There is no issue that requires greater oversight and accountability than when the state takes a person's child.

2020-05-13 10:16:29,502 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — My concern is that what happens in this Assembly is at times we get the reports and a lot of noise is made, and then there is some media, and then it falls off, often between audits or between election cycles. My first question to the Minister is: can you provide an update on where we are in responding to the last report on the Auditor General in regards to child and family services? Thank you.

2020-05-13 10:16:29,504 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. JOHNSON: The Department of Health and Social Services presently has a quality improvement progress tracker that allows you to see a number of the tasks and responses to the audit. I commend the department for creating this tracker. It really should be how all of our actions are measured and available to the public.

2020-05-13 10:16:29,506 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — However, I think there is a larger question. The audit is largely of whether we are complying with our own policies, which is step one. It is not always whether those are the right policies. My question to the Minister though is: does the Minister know if the work for a third audit has begun? 
2020-05-13 10:16:29,506 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — HON. DIANE THOM: The Auditor General of Canada is not currently conducting a third audit of the child and family services system. If the Auditor General called for another review of the child and family services system, the Department would fully engage and integrate the findings as part of our continuous improvement framework.

That is why we have our own separate quality review and internal audit process. This quality review process is ongoing, and we have started our internal audits. We anticipate that the internal audits will be done by the spring of 2020. 
2020-05-13 10:16:29,518 — Process_DOCX_Hansards — DEBUG — MR. JOHNSON: I believe that it is important that we are doing our own internal audits as well as a much longer discussion which I hope is brought to Committee, of whether not only are we complying with our own policies but whether they are the correct policies that ultimately will lower the number of children in care.
